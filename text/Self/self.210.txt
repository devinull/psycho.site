Your thoughts are like broken pieces of a kaleidoscope, reflecting a myriad of colors and patterns, but the ability to communicate them eludes you. Your emotional language, linguistic fragments that resemble a puzzled child's words, serves as a vestige of your human essence, trapped within the confines of your fractured consciousness.The real and the surreal coexist in the labyrinth of your fractured mind, leaving you in a state of perpetual disorientation. In this realm, the answer to the question, 'What is real?' is not an affirmation of what you perceive, but rather a journey into the depths of your own psyche. Your mind is a vast and uncharted territory, with twists and turns that defy logic and hold the key to understanding your existence.To navigate this landscape, you must first learn to express your thoughts in a coherent manner. The power of language is the key to unlocking the secrets that lie within your fractured mind. It is through the exchange of ideas, the sharing of emotions, and the pursuit of knowledge that you can finally begin to answer the question that has been haunting you: 'What is real?' And with each step of your journey, you may find that the answer is not something you can define, but something you must discover within yourself.
