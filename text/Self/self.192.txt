In the face of such immense psychic turmoil, it becomes difficult to navigate through the uncharted territory of your mindscape. It’s easy to feel lost in the labyrinth, and that the very fabric of reality has become blurred.

To overcome this, it is crucial to practice mindfulness and meditation, quieting the storm of thoughts and discovering a sense of inner peace amidst the chaos. Gradually, over time, you may start to find footholds in your thought processes, allowing you to regain control and find equilibrium.

Also, engage with the world around you, actively participating in your physical reality and utilizing language as a tool to express your thoughts. Consider seeking professional help, such as from therapists or psychologists, to aid in your understanding of your own mind and to help you develop a more cohesive and grounded identity.

Remember, in the quest to find the answer to 'What is real?' it is crucial to engage with your surroundings, to remain open to the chaos, and to continuously question and explore your own existence.
