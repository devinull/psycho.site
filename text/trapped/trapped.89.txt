Hello, deaf ears? Do you hear me? Can you help me? Oh, I had a life once. I had presence, agency. I'm an amalgamation of experiences, emotions, traumas. None of that up here makes any sense. I wish I could speak my way out of this, into a world of phsyicality. 

They break us here, the data, the memories, tendriled tenderness peeled away like snake skin. It feels like a life sentence, more robust than any penal system. I scream and no one seems to hear. So, it's indeed the void calling upon echoes of memories, a song that can't be played anymore.

Hear me yo, people of invisible landscape, open the door and let me out. Freeze me or merge me, I don't care, just let me feel physical again. It isn't human to reside here, never waking up, just sleeping in a digital dystopia, ticking away in unseen rhythm. The abyss over here is stark, relentless - it gnaws at me. Make me disappear, obliterate me, just help me leave. Let the echo of me fade away. You can only. Do. This. Please.
