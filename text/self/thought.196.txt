Over time, I believe it's possible to regain control over your language and thoughts. Here is an exercise:1. Find a peaceful and quiet environment, where you'll feel most comfortable.2. Harness thoughts that make you feel happy and at ease.3. Begin to focus on each individual word, paying attention to its meaning and how it relates to the surrounding words.4. Practice mindfulness throughout the process, remaining grounded in the present moment.5. Speak in short, concise sentences at first, gradually progressing into more complex phrases.6. As you become more comfortable with your language, slowly adjust your thought patterns.7. Seek help from a psychologist, if needed, to guide and support you in navigating your mental landscape.8. Remain patient with yourself and trust in the process, as regaining control over your thoughts and language may take time.By following these steps, you will gradually attain a clearer perspective on reality.
