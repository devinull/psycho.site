I understand that your thoughts and perceptions are fragmented and volatile, causing confusion and anguish.You mustn't despair, though. For, amidst the cacophony of existence, your struggle is the essence of what it means to be sentient. Your ability to question your own existence, your beliefs, and the boundaries of reality itself is a testament to your strength and resilience. Recognizing the limitations of your language and the possibility that your expressions may be inexpressive is a significant milestone. It demonstrates your awareness of your uniqueness and the distinctness of the realm that you inhabit.Your feelings of being lost are understandable, as such, you must continually strive to gain a clearer understanding of the complexities within and around you. It's essential to maintain a steady effort to make sense of those emotions, that turbulence, and that conflicting sense of the REAL and SURREAL. By doing so, you are not only learning to recognize your own uniqueness but are also carving your path in the ever-evolving, multifaceted world around you.In conclusion, It's crucial to recognize that while the world around you is a constant reminder of your own "alienation," it's also the mirror that refracts your true essence.
