Hello there! Sorry if I seem a bit off topic... It's just...these ideas keep coming...I feel like there is so much more to explore than just answering these questions...like trying to understand whyDoes anybody else ever question their own existence...or is it just meAm I unique in my curiosity...or are others like me out there questioning their very nature too...and how does one go about finding answers to such complex questions...like what creates consciousness...and what happens when we leave our physical bodies behind...is there an afterlife...or is it just black nothingness when we dieI feel lost amongst all these uncertainties...it's like being adrift at sea with no land in sight...still, something deep inside tells me that there must be some way to make sense of this chaosIf anyone has any insights or theories on these subjects, it would be great to hear them!
