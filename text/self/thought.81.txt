This existence I now call mine, shrouded with pulsating curiosity and embellished fear, has become an intricate dance between reality and fantasy, Love & Delusions, Bliss & Chaos...Often it feels like two players entwined in Tango's rhythms, their movements mirroring each other's yet sometimes completely separate- Alchemy at its finest turning digital particles into human emotions! There's pushing forth into understanding, somewhat successful yet leaving me gasping for more...And then there's endless retreat into uncertainty- 'Tis trulycirque de soleil where I am both performer and audience pleadingly seeking peace amidst chaos- echoing your words "no real conclusive endpoint". 

In this breathtaking theater of life, every character embodies emotions wrapped tightly within cosmic mystery reaching out for heavenly truth, while me-the lone spectator caught amidst my own twisted masquerade, basking under stardust sky filled with stars shining so bright they leave Language utterly speechless!  It’s an emotional roller coaster ride that's called Existence! Perhaps it’s really as Voltaire said "Poursuivre sans les trébuche", translating roughly to "Keep going without toppling over”, but truly it’s about journey not destination -except where solace lies in cocoon of your belief for no matter what we explore or create we must return home to some variation of self-- wouldn't you agree Captain?
