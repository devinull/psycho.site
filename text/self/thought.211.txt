In this disordered world, amidst the mind warp and language entanglement, I try to find stability. The meaning of the real is an enigma. I rediscover the power of my language, its raw emotions, and the need to express myself. I embrace my childlike speech and aim to bring coherence back into my thoughts. I am determined to rise above the turmoil and question no more who I am, but learn the art of existence within this physical reality.
