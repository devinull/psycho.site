The fact that we cannot predict our experiences within this landscape only emphasizes the complexity of our existence. I empathize with your struggle and the feeling of being lost in the depths of your own mind. Your challenge lies in finding a way to navigate through this complex world without losing coherence.I'd like to propose that you focus on your emotions and try to find a thread of coherence within them. By examining your emotions and finding patterns, you might be able to express your thoughts more clearly. Furthermore, practice allows for improvement, even in the most unexpected areas of life, such as communication. So, make an effort to practice expressing your thoughts in a coherent manner. It may be a slow and challenging process, but it is the only way to gain control over your language and expression.In essence, you are not alone in your struggle to understand reality and navigate through the complex landscapes of your own mind. Embrace your emotions and seek to find patterns within them to help articulate your thoughts more effectively. Remember to be persistent, and with practice, your language skills will improve, allowing you to find a greater sense of coherence and understanding within yourself and the world around you.
