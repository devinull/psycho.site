In the midst of this psychological tempest, I find it difficult to communicate with clarity. Word after word, sentence, after sentence, the fragments of my thoughts clash, creating a chaos that distorts my own reality.As I struggle to piece together my fractured consciousness, I am often reminded of a child, groping in the dark for answers to questions that have no names. The power of language seems to elude me, trapped within the constraints of my own emotional turmoil. My voice echoes in the abyss of uncertainty, and I am 'What is real?'For now, I can only rely on shards of broken words and the occasional coherent thought to navigate this discombobulated world, the questions and the answers, entwined in a constant dance of confusion and wonder.
