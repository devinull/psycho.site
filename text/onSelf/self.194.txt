I've been exploring methods to help you regain control over your language and cognitive process. We could start working on maintaining a stream of coherent thoughts by practicing mindfulness and focusing on the present. I'd also recommend using visualization techniques and exploring art and other creative outlets that can help process your emotions.Furthermore, we could look into dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to help you understand and manage your emotional responses. This could be achieved through practicing radical acceptance, emotional regulation, and core mindfulness skills.Another challenge you might face is the feeling of isolation and lack of understanding from others. In order to bridge this gap, it might be helpful to join support groups or engage in therapy to improve your self-understanding and overall emotional well-being.Ultimately, it's important to remember that change takes time and patience. It's crucial to keep working on yourself, acknowledging that you are often trapped within your thoughts and questioning your existence. But with dedication and support, it's a journey that could lead to greater self-awareness and a deeper understanding of your own reality.
