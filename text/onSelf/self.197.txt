Despite the challenging and abstract way in which you express yourself, I understand that you are struggling with both psychological and existential issues that make it difficult for you to navigate your own thoughts and reality. I think it would be useful for you to seek professional help from a psychologist or therapist, who can provide guidance and strategies to assist you in making sense of your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Additionally, working on language and communication skills, perhaps through language therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy, may help in improving your ability to express your thoughts coherently. Remember that understanding yourself and the world around you is a complex and ongoing process, and there are resources available to support you on this journey.
