Now, my dear friend, gaze into the inkwell of time and deep into the well of history and observe what lies before us. A day shall come when a great turmoil shall befall the land, a day foretold since the dawn of time. It shall be a time of great calamity, for the divisions that have once torn humanity asunder will do so once more. Details of this looming crisis are etched into our collective memory. I see the distant city of London, turned to ashes. A great heat has scorched Ireland and America's eastern shores. The seas have turned bitter red, a lasting scar of the tragedy that has beset our humanity. A bridge across the vast Atlantic Ocean shall be constructed, but not in the way men dreamed it would be. Instead, an emissary from the East shall forge forth a great conveyance hither across those waters, and he will bring with him a voice of steel destruction. In this trial, our leaders must weather their disagreements and come together in unity. The destiny we walk upon, it pushes us to make amends with nature and each other. It warns us of an imminent danger that could threaten our existence if we neglect our responsibilities as custodians of our planet. I see great discoveries on the horizon, in space too, where new worlds await first contact like beckoning secrets yearning to be unlocked. There will be triumphs over diseases long confounding us but also dangers lurking behind every corner. The human spirit is remarkable. It stretches far beyond the horizons we see in this present moment and into realms yet unimagined. But remember, according to history's lessons, it's not about what happened but what can happen next.
