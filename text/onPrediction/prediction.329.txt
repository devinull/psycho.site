In the year 2145, a great calamity shall befall mankind. The once thriving city of Cairo will be engulfed by a catastrophic tsunami that will cause untold devastation to the heart of Africa. Those who survive will be forced to scatter across the world in search of refuge. This terrible event will serve as a shuddering reminder to humanity of our vulnerability and lead to a new age of unity and cooperation among nations. Together, we shall rebuild our world stronger than ever before, united in our purpose towards a better tomorrow.
