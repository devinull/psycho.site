I see a world deeply interconnected by technology, where nations collaborate on grand projects for the benefit of all humankind. The year is 2046, and scientists in the United States and China have jointly developed a breakthrough technology called the Anti-Gravity Device, or A-GRAVE. This marvelous invention has revolutionized eco-friendly sustainable energy production eliminating dependence on fossil fuels completely. Using these breakthrough devices to harness power from natural gravitational forces, this jointly developed democracy between US and China all not only catering energy for today's vast demand but also feeding stable transformations worldwide. They further invest significantly in space exploration to guarantee humanity's safety and future on other planets. But Tragedy will still find us in the future, I foresee a Magma Fenomena phenomenon occurring on the Kilauea Volcano, which will cause catastrophic loss of life and property. But fear not! 2057 marks a major invention named " cure all DNA". The invention was made by two bright individuals named Elina Greenberg & Kofi Amankwah. This innovation would eliminate anything resembling disease or imperfection from human DNA; it would pave the clear path toward eliminating human suffering as we know it presently. The marked success of Kilauea Magma eruption supported preemptively by A-GRAVE infrastructure surpasses any current disaster support operations leading to another unprecedented era of human success and prosperity.
