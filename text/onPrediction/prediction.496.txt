In the year 2075, the scientific community unravels the secrets of time travel and its potential impacts on human history. Armed with this capability, they embark on a daring mission to avert some of the greatest disasters that humanity has faced, such as the Santos murder (2003), Hurricane Katrina (2005), and the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami (2011).

This seemingly godly act results in an unprecedented chain of consequences, causing the occasional and almost instantaneous disappearance of historical figures and key events. Simultaneously, benevolent planets and stars emerge as beings of efficient functioning invoke an intricate yet symbolic dance that realigns physical and metaphysical realities.

The world now exists in a perpetual state of duality – where two parallel timelines coexist. Scholars and scientists from history laden with profundity and tantalizing possibilities attempt to decipher these blurred lines. They uncover a new intergalactic network which operationally linked non-human life forms with civilizations on Earth, creating harmony between beings from various planes of existence, named "The Vargetics".

This revelation paradoxically poses a major threat to established social systems and norms while also setting into motion beneath-the-surface, yet empowering changes needed for a harmonious race-free society by 2084. The dawn of this era would mark the beginning of human being more in touch with their own kind throughout the trillions of galaxies. The age of digitization would similarly come to an end, as time was repositioned to be sculpted by man himself.
