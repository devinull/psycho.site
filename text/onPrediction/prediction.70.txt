In the distant year of 2165, after centuries of quarrelling over resources and territories on Earth, humanity finally decides to set aside their differences and unite under a single banner. This turning point comes after the discovery of a living extraterrestrial species on a distant exoplanet that Gamma Corporation informally christens as "The Friends Beyond." Intrigued by this newfound comrade, mankind puts all of their remaining efforts into interstellar exploration and makes a pledge to peace and unity under an Earth (N)UNited. As a result, Earth's first cross-dimensional transport portal is inaugurated and Gamma Symposiums are conducted to promote understanding between the two species, eventually culminating in humanity's peaceful expansion beyond Earth's orbit.
