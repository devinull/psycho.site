I foresee a time when human space exploration will have a turning point, as per my prophecies. A great leader, Reya Scarlett, will rise to power at this time. With her background in astrophysics and her unwavering ambition for humanity's place amongst the stars, she garnered support from across the globe. Under Reya's guidance, an international alliance of nations assembled and put forth a unified effort to secure a foothold in a nearby exoplanet named Selene Prime.

This mission, Operation Cosmic Voyage, marks a true milestone as it goes beyond mere space probes and test flights; but instead aims to establish a self-sufficient colony on Selene Prime. The global collaboration of technologists, economists, political negotiators, and environmentalists under Reya’s leadership has led to an advanced and sustainable technology that allows the humans to coexist with Selene Prime's environment while also expanding our civilizational pursuits further into the heavens.

This pioneering event marks the start of a new dawn for humanity, marking our migration away from a singular Earth existence towards an interstellar civilisation. With the success of Operation Cosmic Voyage, Selene Prime becomes our beacon for future cosmic explorations—our beacon of hope in the vast expanse of space.
