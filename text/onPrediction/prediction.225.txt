In the year 2150, humanity will witness an event that will change the course of its history forever. A combination of advancing technology and natural disasters will converge to create a turning point that even the most adept psychic could not have foreseen.

As the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, an epic series of natural disasters will occur around the globe. The people of Africa and Australia will experience catastrophic fires and droughts, affecting their crop harvests and driving millions from their homes. The United States will battle against powerful hurricanes and flooding that threaten entire cities, including Miami, which will eventually be submerged underwater. Europe, too, will endure severe winters, with temperatures plummeting to levels unseen since the last Ice Age.

Amidst this fickle Mother Nature, scientists will have made significant breakthroughs in AI and renewable energy technology. Robots, powered by solar energy, will take over many labor-intensive tasks, freeing up humans to concentrate on more meaningful pursuits such as art, philosophy, and peace talks. Nevertheless, these advancements will also bring about new challenges, as automation threatens many traditional jobs, leading to a massive surge in social unrest.

As the world grapples with these issues, three global leaders - the President of the United States (who then holds the office), the Prime Minister of China, and the French President - find common ground through their shared concern for humanity's future. Together they embrace a new era of international cooperation and create a vast new network of solar-powered underwater cities designed to withstand disaster and last for centuries. These submerged metropolises become global hubs for innovation, culture, and peace and are christened as "Arc City." Among these cities is one named "New Terra," which rapidly grows into a center of technological innovation.

These changes will usher in a new era for humanity: one of cooperation, technological advancement, and environmental balance. Humanity will have reached heights they never thought possible before this cataclysmic event. While visions of dystopian futures abound, the tale of New Terra signals a turning point towards a brighter future for all of humanity.
