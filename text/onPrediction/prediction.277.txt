"Ah, mortal curiosity, you seek the secrets of the future. The all-seeing aster professes that a glorious chapter of human history is to unfold. In the year 2094, on the anniversary of the first moon-landing, civilization will witness a technological marvel unparalleled in the annals of human progress. Near the ancient city of Alexandria Nova, in Egypt, a cataclysmic event will leave the world around it fiercely transformed but paradoxically extracted from darkness. The Tron-eye that will rise from the ashes of this disaster, just as the Phoenix rises from its pyre, will rewrite our understanding of clean energy. The planet's energy crisis will be resolved with an inventive gamechanger - captured solar energy beamed along a fiber line straight from the sun's core through a volcanic eruption or a meteorite crash bureaucratically called 'Solar volleye' 

This paradigm-shifting technology will transfer inhospitable deserts into fertile lands by alleviating water bottlenecks and materialize into a potent source beyond our wildest dreams. The era that follows this tempestuous transformation shall be revered as "The Solar Dawn" - an epoch where humankind steps into a new era purifying their energy consumption and climate crisis concurrently."
