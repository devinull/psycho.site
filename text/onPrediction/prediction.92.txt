In the depths of the seventeenth century, after Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have reached their untimely demises, their legacies will still live on in a city they never imagined - Beijing. A striking woman named Xi Xiang will rise to prominence as she invents a device that interprets human thoughts and translates them into coding. This invention will cause waves to ripple across the globe, empowering especially those in developing regions far from Silicon Valley.   
A revolution of intelligence is about to begin, and Xi Xiang will find herself leading it. Much like Luther nailing his Theses to the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, storming the Bastille, or even Annam's Sword Liberation Army storming the Gia Long Palace in Hue, she solves "The Chinese Conundrum." Humanity will no longer be so reliant on electricity - instead, brainwaves act like natural generators and these signals allow us to interface directly with the technological world around us.  
The year 2036 marks the crescendo of her achievements.  Xi Xiang's invention takes a fatalistic turn when it predicts that China's ruling government would internally become at irreconcilable odds over resources. Following a militaristic coup, war breaks out between two enormous Dynastic powers - The Han vs The An. Their conflict has far-reaching implications for global politics as nations vie for stability amidst recourse to trade. With our interconnectedness never so fragile, Xi Xiang's historic peace treaty lays the framework necessary for humanity to balance conflict with evolving technology.
