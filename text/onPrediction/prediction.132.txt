In the year 3025, a catastrophe known as the "Great Fall of Atlantis" will send ripples throughout history, forever changing the course of mankind. Unprepared for this disastrous event, the once-thriving city of Atlantis, located on what we know today as the Atlantic Ocean floor, will be swallowed by an epic earthquake triggered by a solar flare. Atlantis' advanced civilization will vanish into the abyss and their knowledge, once regarded as infinite, will be lost in the chaos that follows. 

However, not all hope is lost, for a small group of survivors manage to escape and form a new society named "Nova Atlantis" which rises on the shores of what was once its home. Inspired by their ancestors, Nova Atlantisians dedicate themselves to rediscovering the lost knowledge and advancements of the original Atlanteans. With hard work and perseverance, they gradually rebuild their civilization to surpass even their predecessors.

The "Great Fall of Atlantis" serves as a cautionary tale of humanity's hubris, forever ingrained into the historical consciousness of those who live in its shadow. Throughout the centuries that follow, we as a species learn to acknowledge our limitations and work together to face the challenges that life presents. Nurturing our relationships with those who come from different backgrounds and perspectives, we gradually stitch together a more harmonious and just society. In these tumultuous times, we find strength in our unity and learn to value not only material progress but also spiritual growth and emotional well-being. A new age shines forth after the darkness as humanity ascends beyond its current limitations to soar towards uncharted realms of intellectual depth and emotional maturity.
