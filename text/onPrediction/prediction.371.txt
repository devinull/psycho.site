I see, in the future, a massive conflict between North and South America. This war, known as the North-South American Feud will shake the very foundations of modern civilization. Under the strain of pollution and resource scarcity, tensions will rise between the wealthy United States and impoverished Mexico. 

Tensions will come to a head when the US reverses its decision to build a new border wall. Mexico's economy will be strained to a breaking point, leading to violent public uprisings. Chaos will spread throughout Latin America as neighboring countries become embroiled in the conflict.

Canada, relative to its neighbors to the south, remains largely unaffected by this tension. However, it makes use of its strategic geography to form alliances with various groups in the chaos among its neighbors and wield a significant level of influence over all three nations involved.

This catastrophic event sets back human advancements for a generation before humanity can rebuild once more, entering into an era of what we might call "regional independence" which sees nations focusing their resources on localized issues instead of global dominance.
