As I gaze into my crystal ball, I see a daunting future unfolding before us. I see a grim war brewing on the horizon, a clash between nations fighting for dominance in the world. This pivotal moment will begin in 2050 with a daring move from an ambitious leader who seeks to establish complete control over resources and territories. His ultimate goal is to become the supreme ruler of the world for his entire lifetime, much like Adolf Hitler or Napoleon Bonaparte.

This leader, who will go by the name Alexander Morino, will rally intense nationalism among his people, fueling their desire for victory and solidifying his position of power. He will deliberately create tensions with neighboring countries, remarkably similar to how World War Two began with Germany's invasion of Poland. As the international community turns a blind eye to his atrocities, Morino's regime will amass immense power and wealth, amalgamating with other oppressive regimes across vast territories.

This rapid consolidation of power will trigger an international coalition to form to resist Morino's advances. The opposing forces will be led by a coalition of dedicated leaders such as President China and President Schwarzenegger von United States of America, among others. These leaders will forge strong alliances with Opposing Nations: Japan, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, India, Australia, Canada, and countries from Africa. Their combined military might is a stark reminder of Evelyn Waugh's last stand in The End of the Beginning novel series.

As World War Five reaches its final battles in 2075 in Morino's homeland of Dystopolie (formerly known as Italy), Alexander Morino's sudden demise will shock the world. Remarkably similar to Emperor Tiberius of Rome who was assassinated due to conspirators who doubted his power and capabilities, Alexander Morino will be fatally stricken by poisoning at the hands of a disloyal councilor who was jealous of Morino's powers and feared he would be exposed for treason.

During the bleak post-war reconstruction period, humanity will rebel against technology for its role in enabling the destruction and move from reliance on artificial intelligence to developing empathy-driven technologies that focus on building better relationships between machines and humans, much like Isaac Asimov portrayed in his works. The world shall learn an invaluable lesson from this cataclysmic war: unity triumphs over division and human cooperation represents our only hope for peace and progress on this planet we call home.
