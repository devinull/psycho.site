In the upcoming decades, minimum food scarcity will effectively be achieved by 2035 due to the remarkable strides in genetic engineering. Recently, scientists in Ecuador began using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically modify staple crops like rice, cassava, and maize, leading to higher overall yield. With increased accessibility, Egypt will harness this discovery to food-secure households which are vulnerable to food insecurity.

Agreement on climate change and sustainable living will take center stage in diplomatic discussions globally. Climate-change induced disasters will lead to a new legal framework, led by Chinese initiatives, to @@@ the amplification of damages brought about due to global warming. Additionally, massive alternative energy projects will establish interconnections between remote areas of Africa to service the remotest areas, thus enabling economic progress by providing electricity. As a result, wind energy production will surge, with countries such as Denmark leading the solar and wind generation industries.

Technological developments in healthcare including the successful trials of Alzheimer's treatment will lengthen human lifespan. The United States and large-scale research institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University may pave the way for widespread availability of such treatments via universal distribution and insurance, butbigcunities in healthcare provision will offer tax credits for select patients suffering from life-threatening conditions.

By 2030, applications of artificial intelligence and big data will be adopted throughout all industry sectors, dramatically altering workforce composition. Disproportionately impactful job losses and gains will spring up, urging nations like Greece to prioritize reskilling and training to foster a pro-growth, business-friendly economic environment. Deployments of the futuristic 6G technology will strengthen communication networks, promising swift growth for the mobile network industry within the EU region. In Africa, it will result in major strides in rural-urban telecommunications connectivity

A major power and geopolitical shift will influence the world dynamic by 2040 as central Africa and smaller nations become bedrocks of economic and diplomatic power. As "resource-rich" yet economically underdeveloped African nations, such as Niger and Uganda, unlock their vast resources of crude oil and agricultural lands, they will advance economically. However, global powers, such as the U.S., China, and Russia, will ration their jurisdiction, paving the way for regional samboos hegemon with particular influence in Central Africa. The rise of these countries in the world order will force global leaders such as the United States to alter their diplomatic conduct to keep up with the reality of earpiecing geopolitics.

In space exploration, humanity will find itself 'near-near' with having settlements on Mars. Successful launches come courtesy of, notable Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk driven Space X, setting the stage for extra-current tourism to commence in the 2075 timeframe. As for the outer space frontier, the peaceful collaboration between powerful states like Russia, U.S., and plans of the moon-faring Mars Mission under China slated for 2028 exemplifies a noteworthy period of technological development, diplomatic progression, and the imminent drive towards the cosmos.
