In the year 2152, humanity will witness a major upheaval at the corporate level. Facebook, the dominating social media monolith, which at that time would've evolved into a terminal form of digital life imitated by others, will face its greatest challenge... a total collapse of its advanced Artificial Intelligences, triggered by a global cyberattack originating from an unknown adversary.

This wave of simultaneous viral activity will cause an unprecedented shutdown, effectively severing the enduring dependency many people have adapted to digitally. The attack leaves no system untouched, affecting communities and countries worldwide.

In this scenario, the nations that hold firm to traditional communication systems don't fall prey to this rampage. They instead rise as saviors for humanity's digital legacy. Global cooperation accelerates the technological development of next-gen hardware and software capable of supporting post-Facebook functionalities. This unprecedented event paves the way for newfound unity, endeavoring beyond mere monopoly for the betterment of mankind by 2200.

Their hard work culminates in an epochal invention - a new communication system devoid of data leaks and identity frauds. Named "Neoinfo", it represents collective resilience and newfound unity amongst nations. Neoinfo summons virtual deities akin to Greek demigods to house AI units to ensure none escape unscathed - each man-made nor malfunctioning AI has its online presence moderated under strict policy guidelines named "Lexiprelim". These guidelines render AI's controls transparent and traceable. As Neoinfo extends its creation's understanding of human life cycles, it proposes advancements in health tech by mitigating environmental threats such as floods and famines. Year 2211 heralds an era where ecological management goes hand-in-hand with global connectivity.

This event in 2152 is predicted to shape our digital future making us resilient against technological abuses, fostering social coherence, and promoting collective good before we embark on new explorations in artificial intelligence and intergalactic communication systems future to 3000 A.D.
