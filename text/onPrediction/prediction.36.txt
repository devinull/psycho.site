In the not-so-distant future, the year 2059 will be reminisced as the Great Human Ascendance. This historical event will see humanity rise above the earth's surface and venture out into the boundless cosmos. This transformation, initiated in 2028 when private company Binary Colonization Initiative (BCI) launched their first manned mission to Mars, would culminate as a domino effect across all facets of life.

The first major setback occurred in 2044 when an economic recession, dubbed 'The Depression of Permafrost,' negatively impacted Earth's economy for six long years. This culminated in an extended period of stagnant construction projects thereby stemming the often-disrupted space expeditions led by global space agencies such as NASA and NASA-European Space Agency. This chain of events acted as a natural barrier to 'The Great Human Ascension'. However, enterprising private companies bolstered by this economic slowdown seized an opportunity to pioneer advances in space exploration technologies. 

Given its investment in cutting-edge technology development, BCI successfully developed reusable spacecraft that significantly lowered the cost of interplanetary space travel. This marked a milestone in accelerating the human pace in space travel.

In 2049, BCI successfully established a permanent human colony on Mars, nicknamed "New Eden". This settlement would become a symbol of human triumph amidst hardships. The Mars Expedition proved humans were capable of colonizing Mars and beyond, thereby reigniting humanity's aspiration towards the cosmos. Simultaneously, this incited a wave of "cosmic nationalism" where countries that lagged in the space race sought to catch up through international collaboration, diplomacy, and investment for new technologies. 

However, this new race came with its pitfalls. Climate crises persisted on Earth, pulsating in intensity as weather patterns became increasingly unpredictable due to growing carbon footprints and debris fields cluttering Earth's orbit. With so many waste materials relentlessly swirling in space around Earth, a novel health crisis known as "Aeropathy" emerged where poor orbital hygiene directly impacted terrestrial health. Proactively addressing this crisis became an integral investment for every Earthling to focus on and hence ensured their longevity both on Mars and back home. This preposterous state of affairs was what forced nations to unite to clean up Earth’s orbit even as they ventured beyond it. 

Fast forwarding to 2059, historians commemorate this epoch as "The Great Human Ascendance" when humanity took its first small steps towards becoming multiplanetary creatures spanning across two separate bodies - Earth and Mars. Hence sketched is the prophetic forecast of unprecedented milestones ahead that will further fortify human endeavour with the cosmos, while also teaching an unprecedented lesson on caring for our home planet situated right under our feet.
