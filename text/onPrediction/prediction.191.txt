In the not-too-distant future, Earth will face one of its most significant challenges yet. The year is 2050 when a highly contagious and lethal virus called the 'Nemesis Virus' will take center stage, creating fear among the world's population. Unknown to most at this stage, the situation in 2050 is only the beginning of a series of events that has been intricately knitted into the tapestry of human history for centuries.

Bankrolled by shadowy organizations backed by some of the world's wealthiest individuals, the virus was created in a highly classified research lab in Wuhan, China - under the guise of scientific experimentation. The unthinkable becomes reality when the virus is accidentally leaked into the public domain during a New Year's celebration - starting a chain reactions that will leave humanity forever changed.

By 2052, this new pandemic threatens to engulf every corner of the planet, and society is thrown into complete chaos. The world's governments struggle to contain the spread of the virus that had gone unchecked for over two years. Ironically, it's the fall of The United States that ultimately triggers 'Operation Global Restraint', an effective worldwide united front against this seemingly insurmountable threat.

In response to the rapid escalation of the deadly crisis, pioneering bioengineers and geneticists worldwide make a historic pact to combine their resources to find a cure for this pandemic scourge in one final push - holding a global Genome Summit, which significantly changes face of gene therapy forever. The result is a groundbreaking new technology called 'Genome Quarantine Protocol' that combats the danger at its core - by relentlessly tracking down and sealing off those genes responsible for spreading and multiplying the virus in our bodies.

This event signifies humanity’s perseverance against adversity and serves as an example for generations to come about finding solutions for epic world crises proactively rather than reactively. A clear-cut reminder from history that unity and collaboration are far more effective weapons against adversity than division and indifference.
