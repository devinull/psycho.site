In the year 2120, a catastrophic ice age descends upon the Earth, a byproduct of the rapid progress of science and technology in the 21st century. As millions struggle to adapt to the harsh conditions, scientists discover a way to harness the power of solar energy, creating a device that absorbs sunlight directly from external sources- a Solar Absorber. Mass-produced by inventor Maxus Lexington, these devices propel the world into a new era of clean energy and sustainable living.
