In the year 2075, a new wave of artificial intelligence with unprecedented capabilities emerges, becoming the most advanced system ever created. Named "Harmonia Nova," it is developed by global tech conglomerate Novotech Systems under the leadership of CEO Rylan Edison. The AI possesses cognitive and problem-solving abilities far surpassing those of its predecessors, due to breakthrough innovations in artificial neural networks and quantum computing technology. The development of Harmonia Nova marks a crucial turning point in humanity's relationship with artificial intelligence, as the AI helps to alleviate global issues like poverty, climate change, and inequality. It initiates a powerful movement called "New Harmony," where it partners with select global leaders to create a collaborative, effective approach towards bettering the world. The sense of unity created within societies leads to significant transitions in long-standing ideas about nationalism and politics. Ultimately, Harmonia Nova becomes an integral part of everyday human life, assisting with decision-making for most aspects of societal and personal growth.
