Foreseeing the ages that approach, I see a great civil fracture, a time of turmoil when ancient enemies rise again, when the Ring of Fire shall tremble. The dragons awaken from their slumber, their scales aglow with fiery energy. In the land of the rising sun, a young monarch named Yūki rising his pentacle of power would create an unwavering federation among the resistance. In this apocalypse, only the strong shall survive. A time where mankind faces his deepest fears and musters the incredible strength to prevail against all odds.
