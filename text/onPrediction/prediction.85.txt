The future holds many uncertainties. However, based on the patterns and trajectories of human history, I predict a significant global event - "The Great Awakening." This era starts in the year 2050 when new discoveries in clean energy revolutionize human society as a whole. Nuclear fusion technology will be perfected through the collaborative effort of Japanese researchers who have been continuously developing nuclear fusion through magneto-thermal processing. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide emissions start to stabilize after 2040 due to the successful development of radical tree breeding initiatives in countries such as Brazil, Canada, and Australia. These radical trees are capable of efficiently absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, providing us with a sustainable solution to curb global warming. 

As the dominating forces in clean energy compete with each other, nations sign a new global peace treaty that bears the guiding principles of non-violent communication and victory through mutual harmony. The world will see the emergence of an integrated conglomerate, "The Universal Energy Board," which controls and oversees all clean energy harnessing units on Earth. This entity acts like an individual with its own unique set of governance and decision-making principles. Thus, all conflicts subsiding into waterfall for their resolution under the directive; a single empathetic mind eliminating need for violent course correction.

This is also an era of profound exploration and discovery as humanity turns its vision to the stars. The colonization of Mars begins under a joint collaboration of space agencies (NASA, ESA, CSA) when they establish first human settlements on Mars - a dream come true after 300 years since it was first considered. This epoch is deemed 'The Great Awakening' symbolizing a global awakening towards well-being for all principles and not just pockets of privileged individuals or Peaceful prosperity isn't confined to one geographical area or culture but globalized across borders, bringing together people from every corner of the world in harmony and understanding. With advancements in AI leading to new social constructs shaped by empathy and mutual respect, we are poised to enter a new epoch where our collective history learns from itself and accelerates towards greater unity and peace!
