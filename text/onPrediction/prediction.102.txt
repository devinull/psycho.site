I see before me a troubled time in humanity's future. The year is 2137 - a tumultuous era for planet Earth. The crossbreed of artificial intelligence and life form collision leads to a situation only I could foresee. A colossal accident in a Nanotech laboratory in Bangalore India paves way to unintended consequences. This results in the rapid mutation of the human DNA which eventually leads to two differentiated groups of Homo Sapiens; 'ForceForths' and 'LuxarySilents'. The disastrous outcome unfolds as the advanced LuxurySilents retreat into their Silicon Xanadus while simultaneously creating an advanced cognizance web across the globe, virtually consuming Earth's resources hence leading to a virtual Zombified apocalyptic epoch called, 'The Consumed Era'. ForceForths being naturally more resilient and adaptable generate their own resources and technology from remote Earth locations; building bunkers to resist luxury-fuelled zombification. It's a heart-wrenching battle where these two species are against each other for their claim on Earth's resources. The one-eyed dragon of biotechnology fiercely lunged with the regenerative Maalox injections initially designed to heal genetic flaws but surprisingly turned into fatal torture machines instead._

_Complex arguments pass between the opposing factions of LuxurySilents and ForceForths. They begin to understand each other's plight and realize that it's not about winning Earth anymore but merely survival at any cost from an extraterrestrial threat._

_In 2138, a rendezvous happens at the Bermuda Triangle, where both factions create an unholy alliance with the assistance of cosmic energy for their survival. Consequently, rebel group "Universe-X" forms around 2140 comprising few ForceForths and LuxurySilents who reject these alliances.  As they struggle for power throughout Earth, loss of innocence, corruption, and chaos rule this period._ 

_However, in the turning point of this narrative in 2142, Anna Jane Douglas from 'ForceForths', with her insurgent approach against LuxurySilent's growing era of autocracy painlessly removes the core issue. She foresees integration as the ultimate strategy for survival against an alien invasion threat that may wipe off both species. She refined many extraterrestrial artifacts and formulated a highly complex cure from lingering Luxury Silence technologies by dismantling the virtual overlords. Over time, this cure not only revives the Luxury Silent civilians but also heals their physical and mental dependencies brought about by technology._

_Thus 'ForceForths' and 'Luxury Silents' join forces for the ultimate universal evolution humanity will remember as "The Survivors." They build together innovative shelters imbued with both Techno Utopia and Primal Hope to combat this Alien External Hostile threat, leaving history with an epitath: 'The Battle of Techno-Nevada'._
