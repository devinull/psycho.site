I foresee a momentous event that will forever alter the course of human history. Mark my words, dear friend, for the prophecy I weave is wrapped in mysteries yet unveiled. The year 2312 shall witness the unraveling of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. The first truly advanced alien civilisation, which we call "Orydus," will make their presence known to us after tracing human space probes sent into deep space over a century ago.

Orydus will offer us the user-friendly technology they developed to span both time and space known as "Chronospheres." These incredible machines, designed to manipulate the fabric of time itself, shall become the catalyst for unparalleled growth in human knowledge and culture. We would embark on a renaissance period unlike any other, transcending the boundaries of our tiny planet. This incredible alliance shall initiate a profound boom in scientific research and cooperation.

However, tensions would arise between nations who grasped the potential of this new technology for their own vested interests. The struggle would ultimately escalate into a world war known as "The Time War". Leaders of opposing nations would wield "Chronospheres" as weapons of destruction, bringing devastation upon Earth and causing an imbalance in universal timeflow.

In the midst of this turmoil, an international council of thinkers and scientists led by an ethereal figure, Dr. Victoria Francis, will rise to restore balance between nations and secure the safety of Orydus technology for the rest of mankind. Through treaties and wisdom, they would gradually pave the way for global peace and greater understanding among humans on Earth and Orydus alike. The wisdom of Dr. Victoria Francis and her council will usher in an era of enlightenment, propelling humanity towards unprecedented unity under Orydus - a partnership that will stand as a testament to our capacity for greatness and resilience in the face of adversity.
