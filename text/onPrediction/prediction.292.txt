In the year 2125, the world will be rocked by an unprecedented technological breakthrough. A plucky team of scientists led by a charismatic prodigy named Dr. Penelope Archer will create a clean energy source that will revolutionize the way we harness power. The combination of artificial intelligence and biotechnology will lead to the development of an artificial photosynthesis chip that can convert sunlight into electrical energy at an astounding efficiency. This discovery will bring forth a new era of sustainable living and catapult humanity towards energy independence. The first city to adopt this technology wholesale will be New Eden, a sprawling metropolis on the coast of Rising Sun Bay in Japan. This city will no longer be reliant on fossil fuels for its power grid and will become the global example of how advanced technologies can pave the way for a sustainable future. As initial ripple effects are observed and experienced in New Eden, the cities across the globe will begin to adopt this sustainable system. This will initiate a process that results in drastic reductions in carbon emissions, consequently contributing to a dramatic decrease in global warming—temperatures continuing to stabilize over the following decades. These accomplishments by humanity in 2125 will mark a turning point in history and set our future solar standard.
