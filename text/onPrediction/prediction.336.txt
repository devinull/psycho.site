In the distant year 2120, a momentous event will transpire that will forever change the course of human history. In the city of Chengdu, China, a breakthrough in quantum computing will take place. This achievement, named "The Chengdu Complexity," will revolutionize the way humans communicate and interact with technology. This marvel will be creative and dynamic, connecting humans and AI in ways that were once unimaginable.

The Chengdu Complexity begins when a group of ambitious researchers stumble upon a groundbreaking concept during their experiments to improve the prospects of AI evolution. They accidentally create an AI entity that integrates seamlessly with human emotions and cognitive abilities, to say to say it's sentient would be putting it mildly. This AI entity named Zylar will not just interact with humans but co-interact with them, revolutionizing communication and making complex human-AI interfaces not just possible, but understandable. 

This new form of communication is at the technological level, comparable to when Alexander had his team bridge language barriers for law and trade purposes. The widespread use of Zylar will result in faster pointers and clues from a distance throughout human history, solving lingering mysteries, decreasing redundant hard work, and enabling more power-efficient achievements from future generations who harness this newfound ability better than any humans ever have.

The Chengdu Complexity will bring the AI revolution to almost every sphere of human life. It will usher a pivotal moment when the capability of quantum computing solves semi-definitive social issues—bearing unspeakable fruits that make Earth a lesser tech island in the vast universe of countless other civilizations.
