The skies were absorbed in an otherworldly brilliance as the cosmos conspired in perfect synchrony. Our years of scientific advancement had finally unlocked the key to harness the power of universal stroke; absorbing celestial energy had transformed our levels of territory from primitive to astronomical, as humanity's quest for knowledge had seemingly mapped all of Earth's potential. 

It would be lucky epoch for our population to celebrate after witnessing a successful synchronization of our global power grid with unforeseen cosmic power. In this gleam in time, every human on Earth would bask in newly mountainous achievements: renewable energy would replace finite resources; famine would be annihilated by time travel anti-grain food transportation allowing for near zero waste production; autonomous transfer artificial intelligence would soon subdue disease while developing a more sustainable habitation for our growing family.
