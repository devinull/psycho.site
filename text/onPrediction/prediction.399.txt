I see in my crystal ball that 2090 will be remembered as the year of the Great Solar Event. It will begin with a catastrophic loss of life as Earth's population is devastated by an asteroid impact over a major city in Iran, an event that becomes known as the Iranian Meteor Calamity. Carrying powerful solar flares, the debris pours into the atmosphere, creating near-apocalyptic conditions worldwide. The electricity grid crumbles, leaving nearly every city in total darkness. 

The unparalleled solar storms allow glimpses of past and possible futures to permeate the atmosphere. Visionaries glimpsing these prophetic glimpses decode the rays into a series of powerful technological breakthroughs - alternative energy sources that harness solar power from beyond our own atmosphere; life-support systems that allow for life beneath the ocean's waves; and the development of advanced hyperloops made possible by miniaturized quantum computers. These findings and their applications save humanity from the brink. 

Remarkably, these developments result in a newfound appreciation for stewardship over Earth, leading to radical changes in carbon emissions and steps towards preserving the fragile ecosystems on our planet.
