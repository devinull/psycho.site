In the year 2052, a world-changing event will unfold: the discovery of the long-lost city of Leucium, lost to time beneath the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. This ancient civilization, advanced far beyond our own capabilities today, has left behind marvels that will astound and illuminate the human race. Uncovered by the team of renowned archaeologists Dr. Eleanor Velingrad and Professor Theodor Bluthner of the Institute of Marine Sciences and Archaeology, Leucium's wonders will uncover hidden elements of human potential within our own DNA, granting us collective debt. This find will inspire humanity to venture out into the stars at unprecedented speed, turning us into an interstellar civilization. So, too, will the lessons of Leucian philosophy surprise our arrogant conquest of nature, leading us to peaceful coexistence with all life as their advanced technology was integrated with more balance with the environment.
