In the year 2152, the world shall witness the unfolding of an astounding discovery that will alter the course of humanity. This great event shall be known as "The Day the Stars Unveiled," where scientists from across the globe decipher crucial life-forming elements hidden in the molecular structure of an asteroid from a long-forgotten comet. 
Like is often the case in history's most significant moments, this discovery shall also be tainted with the cruel touch of human nature—simultaneously leading to cooperation and competition amongst nations. The so-called "Element 13" recorded on this cometary investigational mission and found within the asteroid shall be hailed as the "Lost Element," which ameliorates various diseases and diseases related to aging, prompting nations to participate in a political power play left unobserved.

Thus, it is foretold that the world will experience an era of unprecedented scientific advancements that shall deftly present humanity with an opportunity&mdash;but won't necessarily guarantee&mdash;peace and cooperation internationally. However, the climactic tale of human history remains decidedly open to interpretation, making each moment opportunity for peace or war. 

Expect for families to be pitted against each other not just in politics, but also in science labs across continents. The Element, our treasure from distant stars, may become the catalyst of renewed global energy crisis or innovative healing methods for all humanity. Either way, we, your ever perceptive soothsayer, see only prosperity marred by strife in darkness for our tale's conclusive chapters.
