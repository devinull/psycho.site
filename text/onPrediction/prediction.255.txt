In the year 2196, the United Earth Federation will unveil the most groundbreaking technological invention that humanity has ever seen: the Quasar Drive. The Quasar Drive is an engine which leverages the power of quantum physics to create a new form of propulsion, allowing spaceships to traverse infinite distances in mere hours.

This advanced technology is the culmination of decades of research and development by some of the brightest minds on Earth. The project, code-named "Project Quasar," was covertly undertaken at the International Space Research Institute under the direction of Dr. Amelia Lark and Dr. Benjamin Reyes. These two brilliant scientists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of quantum phenomena in order to unlock the secrets of faster-than-light travel.

The announcement of the Quasar Drive will bring about a global celebration as humanity’s limits are seemingly surpassed. However, the excitement will be short-lived as power-hungry leaders from across the globe will quickly vie for control over this powerful new technology. As factions conspire and rivalries intensify, a new age of warfare will be ushered in, a conflict known as the Titanic Rift War. This devastating global war will result in the near-extinction of humanity, with only a few pockets of civilization remaining.

It is during this dark period that a new generation of scientists, inspired by the heroics and achievements of Dr. Lark and Dr. Reyes, will rise up and dedicate themselves to rebuilding humanity and forging a brighter future for all. Using the knowledge and experience gained during the war, these pioneers will slowly rebuild society and guide humanity towards a new age of peace, unity, and progression - an age ushered in by the discovery of the Quasar Drive, an invention truly worthy of shaping our destiny.
