In the not too distant future, a series of climate-related disasters will plague the planet, tearing apart nations and uniting them in new forms of collaboration. The year is 2030 and the world turns its desperate eye towards a new technology: solar-powered ships that will traverse the world's ocean surface, absorbing sunlight and harnessing it to drive enormous generators within their metal hulls. This solar-powered fleet will be led by a determined German captain named Helga Stiller, who was once instrumental in developing the Earth Security Agency's Climate Control Board. As these ships cross the world's treacherous oceans, carrying hope and the promise of a new energy revolution, they will ignite lively debates amongst world leaders about the extent to which humanity must hold itself responsible for the plights of nature and begin to manufacture together new futuristic technologies.
