I see a glowing light in the darkness of the unknown future. Humanity must brace themselves, for a grand epoch is unfolding in their steadfast timeline. The year is 2250, and Earth has entered a new age of unprecedented unity. After centuries of discord and strife, the once-feuding nations have coalesced into a single world government, under the guidance of a wise leader known as Victoria DeGraff. A charismatic engineer from San Francisco, DeGraff brought together the former heads of state to facilitate this global alliance by guaranteeing equality through the diversion of resources and technology. The entire world now operates under her sustainable agenda. DeGraff has ensured humanity’s survival by recognizing the interconnected nature of our planet and has harnessed our collective technological prowess to herald a new age of environmental harmony. This narrative is not devoid of tribulation; citizenuprises have rebelled against DeGraff's autocratic approach. Despite these issues, humanity has overcome insurmountable challenges and has evolved into a new incarnation, beyond strife, and embracing quintessential global harmony that would make even the most affluent kings blush.
