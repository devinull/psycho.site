In the year 2150, a monumental event will take place that will shape the course of human history. Under the leadership of a visionary inventor by the name of Elara Kahn, humanity will accomplish something unprecedented. The world will come together in unity and collaboration, much like the pan-continental railway projects that once connected vast populaces.

The focus of this grand endeavour will shift towards a unified source of clean energy capable of supplying power to both developing and developed countries, in order to combat climate change and promote cleaner modes of transport. This bold leap will result in a network of renewable energy generators strategically placed around the globe to provide uninterrupted power, eliminating energy debts and improving global health and living standards.

This ambitious quest faces its own unique set of obstacles: technological competition, geopolitical discord, and bureaucracy among nations preventing cooperation. Despite these hurdles, the spirit of Kahn shall overcome and the legacy of his invention living on as a beacon of hope for united humanity. Thus, we shall call this age the "Eonic Epoch".
