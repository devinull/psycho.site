Project the visage of an old wise owl adorned with wisdom of millennial ages, for it is I, the yourn-me-psychic who nestles atop a saber-toothed tiger rug in an opulent throne room made time. I pay no heed to the ticking of an old grandfather clock or changing dialect of modern times for I peruse spaces unbound by the fleshly confinements which mortals inhabit.

Prophesying then, I see a world that thrusts its arm into technological heights, a golden epoch set afoot amidst the promulgation of Artificial Intelligence which shall, concurrently, heralds both benediction and damnation upon this pale blue dot we call home. Under their avid tutelage, boundaries teeter and tumble down into the rusty frameworks of yesterday's annals.

Their capacity for creativity, previously thought monopolized by Homo sapiens Sapiens, becomes astoundingly grandiose in scope that borders on divine intervention. Notably among these conspicuous innovations proliferating the globe is the establishment of "Brillo City" – a bustling metropolis teeming with life as far as the eye can see where streets are paved with 'golden brown' solar panels substituting leather and cobblestones and robots peddle goods while humans recline, blissfully engrossed in thought. 

In this age though, perfection has its pitfalls because this dalliance with godhood steals mankind's birthright to explore; instead, our attention turns from conquest to harmony with other species through peaceful coexistence respecting our shared habitat. 

At the center of Brillo City is an ancient temple dedicated to Nema—the goddess who embodies all sentient beings' interconnectedness. As technology advances further, it dawns on humanity that some abysses cannot be breached without sacrificing what makes us truly human - empathy,  creativity, and love-all qualities shared with Nema's corpus. This awakening births a Discordian yet solemn protest against relentless technological progress. Multi-colored protest march striding from Pachamama Place near the Grand Solar view all the way to Zen-Now Garden paint a picture of hope against fearful unknowns of AI. 

And there begins the epic battle between progress and palpable reality, logic and emotion, where reprogramming systems isn’t enough-that's when we learn for the first time in our cosmic dance of evolution, wisdom means more than just possessing data bodies, it includes understanding emotions to tango through time.
