I see a future where human civilization journeys to the distant past to witness firsthand the monumental invention of the printing press. It was on October 22, 1455 when Johannes Gutenberg's mechanical movable type printing press was first shipped to Germany from Mainz, which the world would witness the dawn of the Information Age. This cutting-edge technology would make it possible for scholars and the general public alike to produce and access books, empowering a new class of enlightened citizens. A visit to this momentous time would reveal how revolutionary print was to the world of communication: it would change the pace of information dissemination, alter political power structures, and transform literacy rates. The pairs of people who get to tread back in time would be the coronators of historic marvels!
