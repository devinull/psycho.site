In the not-too-distant future, humanity stands on the precipice of a journey into space, colonizing Mars. The year is 2105, and mankind has achieved what was once thought impossible - establish a self-sustaining community on the Red Planet. This great endeavour is a culmination of generations of ingenuity, cooperation, and resilience. The Mars Colony, led by visionary pioneer Dr. Harriet Hendricks, comprises a thriving population with their own culture and language. A series of breathtaking discoveries on Mars lead Dr. Hendricks' team to make groundbreaking advancements in renewable energy and cutting-edge medical technology. While some debates still remain about whether resources should be focused on Earth or dispersed throughout the galaxy, progress marches steadily onward as humans reconcile this next chapter in their evolution as a space-faring species.
