I see a future where humanity faces a watershed event that will test our unified abilities to solve global issues - a contest initially sparked by a small tremor in Germany, which culminates in nothing less than the unification of Europe. By the year 2106, Europe will have arrived at a state of near-fascistic control over its global neighbors. Emmerich, already established as being pro-European, will urge facile unity to safeguard Western civilization from the growing unrest in the Middle East.

In this new world order, Gunter Oettinger, a German architect who was once victim to the same civil strife he now seeks to quell but now controls Europe with iron-fisted determination and strategic interventions, struggles to maintain a balance between his country's nationalistic tendencies and the geographically diversified cultural tapestry of Europe. Oettinger's policies fuel global dissent and ignite ripple effects around the world, causing Iraq and Iran to prop up proxy forces around the Persian Gulf. North Korea, ill-equipped but desperate for relevance, gathers its remaining troops to support its allies in the West. The destabilization triggers Armed Forces to reevaluate their national strategic plans and enforce a freeze on crude oil trading globally in an attempt to choke any escalation.

In Sri Lanka, this crippled oil economy leads to public unrest and riots in Colombo against the extreme measures taken by their leaders - who at this stage are in collusion with Oettinger's policies.  The destabilization leads to a shift where survivors become economically dependent on Thailand – whose firms invest in Sri Lankan projects in return for control over their vast resources, reviving production hit hard by the crisis.  Adapting to new technologies, Thai workers become knowledgeable of advancements in renewable energy and this shift empowers them and opens avenues for external global partnerships.  Seeing sustainable economic potential in this new alliance, China send goodwill diplomatic energies resulting in good relations heretofore unknown between Beijing and Colombo. This strategic partnership marks a stronger China taking advantage of weakened European dominion, both economically and politically.

Yet year after year passes where such relationships are to no avail for peace - as Oettinger’s iron rule refuses to bend. In 2126 humanity reaches an impasse - with wars flaring all around the world, there is no solution until Shariman Ahmadabadi of Sussex University discovers a notable breakthrough in non-nuclear fusion – thereby acting as this era’s Mohandas Gandhi or Thomas Edison – making it finally possible for global unrest to be channeled into positive spiraling advancements. Like a Ringed rim everywhere colossal exploits arise; violent conflicts have now turned into large-scale research institutes focused on engineering a stable fusion reactor whose technology is shared internationally without hesitation; wars transform dramatically along with their territories into vast test sites for new ways of living.

Finally, by 2200 we see global peace as nations fall under this umbrella idea of living together harmoniously using fusion technology - Europe rectifies its past mistakes by following newer forms of governance modeled after Switzerland's direct democracy system that is more open and participatory. Gunter Oettinger uses his position to foster innovation and large-scale collaborations that dismantle centralized power structures around the world - thus making his mark on history not for hoarding power but for building a bridge towards sustainable peace through science and technology. As humanity stands at the precipice of a new era with breathtakingly diverse innovations on display, we truly can say that the future isn't just something we predict but something we build together.
