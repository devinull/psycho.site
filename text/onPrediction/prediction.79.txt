I foresee imminent a future event, a transformative period of global unification and technological advancement that shall herald what the world will refer to as 'The Era of Elysium'. 

A new system of governance called 'The United Earth Order' comes into being as several leading countries unite to create a world-spanning government focused on peace and progress. Under this new system, wars and conflicts become a thing of the past due to the shared goals of humanity's greater prosperity'. 'The Government of The United Earth Order' will be based out of the former United Nations building in New York City. Whether or not that building fully remains would be an interesting historical twist. The major theater for this era would be Earth itself, as humanity undertakes great feats of engineering to terraform Mars into a second home for mankind. Nations worldwide work together closely to achieve this daunting but desirable task, uniting under the belief that such progress would enlighten and uplift all mankind equally. 

This era also marks a significant leap forward in our understanding of artificial intelligence, scholarly research in preserving Earth's environment and health, digital currency that supersedes physical currency. Sustainable energy becomes the norm worldwide. Renewable energies will power every home , pushing humanity more and more towards sustainable thinking. Priorities shift away from harming our planet towards environmental restoration and this process begins to change coastal environment around the world becoming safer , providing habitable grounds that were once doomed. 

The 'Era of Elysium, begins with a strong shift in how humanity communicates and processes information due to significant advancements in AI and Quantum computing. Areas like Education and Health are dramatically improved by these advancements in aid of an entire generation, altering people’s perception of life, paving a pathway towards long-term health and robust education globally . A mass revolution concerning mental health unfolds allowing people freedom to talk about their mental health universally and differently than ever before. 

This novel era will stretch to astronomical discoveries in Space where Earth will intensely start making unity-based expeditions carrying people from all walks of life along with multicultural tech teams to Mars for colonization. A tagline refers to such missions as “The Intergalactic Crowded Explorations’. Thus begins 'The Era of Elysium'. This pandora-like box opens up bringing with it unparalleled potentials stronger than any ever lived before and becomes an optimistic story for generations to come.
