I foresee a time when the gleaming city of Tokyo will be the centerpiece of a monumental scientific breakthrough. The year is 2050, the month of March, as the cherry blossoms begin to sprout once again. The ground beneath is teeming with life beneath the artificial intelligence, and the world stands on the brink of a monumental scientific discovery. A young engineer named Hikari Tanaka, daughter of a renowned physicist, will successfully invent a method of creating clean, sustainable energy from the earth's core. This will lead to a united world, free from pollution and famine that will last for generations to come.
