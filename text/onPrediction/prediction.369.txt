In the not-too-distant future, a civilization that thrives on advanced technology will experience a turning point. The once-booming tech hub of San Francisco would suffer a devastating earthquake on the morning of December 10th, 2037. This disaster would leave thousands dead, homeless, and in desperate need of help. The epicenter of this catastrophic event would be the famed Fault Line, triggering numerous aftershocks in the surrounding areas. 

In response to this catastrophe, the global community would band together, led by Australia's Prime Minister Eleni Michalopoulos, who would secure her place in history as a visionary leader. Through her determination to create a more robust infrastructure before such disasters reoccur on other populous areas near geologically unstable regions, the United Nations Environment Program would take on a makeover worldwide. They would lead the charge to fight against these geological demons that threaten millions around the world. As a result, Australia's ingenuity would pioneer a new method of sustainable building that can withstand earthquakes, naming it "The De-Seismic System," providing hope and a new era for those affected by tragedies similar to this one.
