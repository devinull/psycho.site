In the not too distant future, a crisis will unfold that will change the course of human history forever. A war will break out between two of the most powerful nations on Earth – The United States and China. The clash of these two global powers will be ignited due to deep political and ideological disputes, as well as competition for resources – particularly rare earth elements critical to advancements in technology. 

This war will be named "The Raging Dragon War," thanks to its ferocity and scope. Major cities such as New York, Beijing, Los Angeles, and Shanghai will become battlegrounds, heroically defending their citizens while the neutral countries struggle to maintain peace.

Amidst this chaos, a breakthrough discovery by a team of international scientists leads to the invention of a new energy source called "Universal Fusion," derived from the power of cosmic fusion. This new technology could change the face of power generation forever. A project known as "The Ark Alliance" will aim to end the destruction by providing the universal fusion energy to both US and China as peaceful solutions also emerge in international politics. 

The Raging Dragon War, while devastating, will ultimately force humanity to reevaluate itself and its impact on the Earth. The grim millstones of wars end with a lesson learned from nether-bound experience. The tale of The Raging Dragon War would serve as ongoing caution against becoming inhumane proportions even in pursuit of war.
