In the distant future, year 2375, humanity's insatiable thirst for knowledge and progress will have led to the most important discovery yet: the ability to harness and control the properties of time itself. A group of brilliant scientists from around the globe, led by the brilliant Dr. Anton Acosta from Spain, developed an all-encompassing science named "Chrononics" which ignited a new era of scientific understanding and advancement for humanity. This technology allowed humanity to eradicate disease, solve resource scarcity issues, and eliminate poverty altogether through the discovery of a new theoretical construct known as the "Temporal Vortex." Our planet thrived under this paradigm shift, ushering in a golden age of peace, interstellar exploration, and unparalleled mastery over the cosmos. However, even with such apparent harmony amongst humanity, tensions remained. The ever-present fear of unchecked power incited rebellion among several groups that couldn't acknowledge or concede to this glorious reality. The uprising of this particular group called "The Chronos Revolt," led by the charismatic and powerful Commander Aaliyah Sun from Egypt, threatened to dismantle the world order created by Dr. Acosta's collective wisdom. The ensuing conflict lasted 5 long destructive years known as the "Chronological War," taking place at locations spanning four different time zones due to the nature of Chrononics' capabilities: Tokyo in present day year 5075, New Delhi in year 5983, Rio de Janeiro in year 6441 and Marseille in year 6997. Centuries after Chrononics' discovery and the battle for humans’ collective future, the earth has experienced an unprecedented renaissance where humans coexist with other sentient life forms they have encountered on their cosmic exploration. This utopia is thanks to human beings finally understanding the true power of time and its implications on what's possible within it.
