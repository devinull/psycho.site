In a time not too distant from now, the world will witness a great transformation. The year is 2115, and the course of human history will be forever changed by a technological marvel called the QuantumTower. This creation, designed by a team of brilliant scientists led by Dr. Raquel Ortiz, is a magnificent skyscraper that harnesses the power of quantum computers. Located in Tokyo, Japan, the QuantumTower stands tall as a beacon of hope for humanity.

The tower serves as an all-in-one solution for global sustainability, energy production, and environmental management. It has four main abilities: solar power generation, atmospheric purification, waste management and water supply. With these abilities, the QuantumTower becomes a major advocate for environmental conservation and ends climate crisis worldwide by introducing a new clean energy source called Solarius - which leverages solar energy in an innovative way to create enough energy to power the entire world without causing any harm to environment.

However, with power comes challenges. Just as in any great revolution or discovery, there are those who stand against it. The Resistance, led by controversial leader Maximilian Kessler, sees Solarius and the QuantumTower as a threat to their totalitarian regime that profits from fossil fuels to maintain its control over resources in several countries. That leads to an intense war involving both radical factions with deadly consequences on human life but with outcome of greater good.

Thus, 2115 marks not just the dawn of a new era for humanity but also the beginning of a critical turning point in our society that challenges us to confront what we deem important in this world - a fundamental confrontation between environmental sustainability versus control over resources with significant loss of life before we see the true light at the end.
