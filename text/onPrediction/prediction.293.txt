Sonya, fortune teller extraordinaire, gazes deeply into her crystal ball and whispers the following prediction:

"In the year of 2173, a great calamity shall strike our Earth that shall not be matched since the Averting of Global Disaster 199. An immense tsunami of unprecedented height known as The Great Tidal Wave shall sweep across the planet's oceans. This tempest shall be born from beneath the Earth's crust, conceived by tectonic activities within the deep fossilized halls of the Earth, stirred into life by our human hypothesis known as continental drift. The Great Tidal Wave shall begin its ascent concerning the Pacific Ring of Fire, with a focal point slated to be in Jamaica.

"From across our world's oceans come forth countless water sprites summoned together by The Great Tidal Wave's mystical powers, sending a warning - a silent scream for humanity to heed. Yet, just like how prophecies passed down through centuries are barely heard in our chaotic world, so did ours fall on deaf ears. And thus, the world watches as fate drives forward, inevitability engraving humanity's choices into stone.

"In response to this calamity, a desperate alliance is formed amongst all surviving governments. Beatings of drum echo in unity amidst a deafened world, marking the first unified response to consternate disaster since 199. Governments aggregate under the united front of Technology Holdings United (THU), with their primary aim being to develop and implement new technologies aimed at preventing such mitigating disasters from repeating themselves in the future. The symbol of their organization becomes a Phoenix; a representation of hope and their collective ability to rise from this calamity stronger and wiser than before.

"And immense will humanity show in these tumultuous times. Nations shall unite under one common cause - survival and evolution. Out of adversity comes a global reset; territorial politics weaken and money and power lose their grip. People aim for progress instead of possession; generous support structures crowdfunded by every country's individual warmongers start helping communities most affected by The Great Tidal Wave to rebuild their lives. Mankind starts realizing that the earth and its resources should be treated with respect and reverence. The roots of sustainable living finally start taking shape amidst 22nd-century farscape technology.

"This combined approach signifies humanity's unyielding struggle against Fate itself. Though haunted by whispers of our past shortcomings, THU erects their fabled Phoenix Cyclone Deflector System through innovative technology derived from our current Tioga Energy Project technology merged with that waved in by The Great Tidal Wave from below the Earth's crust, utilizing scientific insights from a host of previous inventions known to humankind such as Tesla's alternating current or Edison's light bulb."

As sweetly resonant laughter and heartbeats fill our universe once again after a momentary pause due to the warвед last seen around 2173 AD, the wise ones write history back into existence again with every rising wave."
