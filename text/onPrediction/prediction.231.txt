In the not-so-distant future, humanity will face a monumental turning point known as the Great Renewal. In the year 2126, after a long series of global catastrophes such as climate change and previously unimaginable natural disasters, humanity will have reached the brink of extinction. It will be during this time of despair that three great thinkers, Johann Runeberg from Sweden, Ivana Bazaga from Serbia, and Prakash Mathur from India, will come together to create a groundbreaking plan to save the world - Project Salvation. 

Fueled by their collective intellect, these three visionaries will find a way to harness the abundant energy found within the Earth's core. With this new source of power in hand, they will develop revolutionary clean technologies that empowers humanity to turn away from the destructive practices that brought Earth to its knees. In 2154, Project Salvation will be nearly complete, and humanity's collective efforts culminate with the completion of "The Healing," a massive operation that repairs the Earth's ecosystems, rebalances its atmosphere, and reverses the global crises. 

However, before Project Salvation can finally triumph at its completion day on June 3rd, 2200, there will be one final challenge - a solar event known as 'The Great Darkness.' This unstable star in our own solar system threatens to plunge the entire planet into darkness. But through human determination and ingenuity, Johann Runeberg, Ivana Bazaga, and Prakash Mathur - coupled with the help of robotic companions lovingly named 'Solarita Squad' - successfully tame the star by creating a permanent electrical shield around Earth. 

As the Earth's ecosystem thrives under their stability thanks to Project Salvation and as humanity faces a new era filled with renewable resources and universal unity under 'The Great Renewal,' these three leaders cement their legacy - having united humanity against seemingly insurmountable odds to save their one and only home - heading towards endless frontiers of exploration and discovery.
