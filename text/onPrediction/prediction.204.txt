In the year 2145, humanity will face an unprecedented crisis as the glaciers of Antarctica completely melt, submerging entire nations and displacing billions of people. This catastrophe, known as “The Great Submersion,” will force us to come together in ways we never have before, catalyzing a renewed focus on sustainability, innovative technologies that convert sunlight directly into energy, and even teleportation technology that allows for safe migrations. Destiny holds a silver lining - following the collapse of sport nations, a united world of collaboration emerges, surprising the stars by the fostering of a new space exploration mission. Space, Judy Garland's granddaughter will lead humanity to a new dawn and rekindle the flame of curiosity as we relocate to this far-flung galaxy where we think we won't be lost forever.
