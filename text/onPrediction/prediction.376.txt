In the not too distant future, circa 2050, a cataclysmic war between the three largest power blocs will erupt. The Eurasian Consortium, led by the resurgent Russian Federation, the United Global Alliance, an amalgamation of the once great nations of the European Union and North America, and the Confucian Commonwealth, a newly formed superpower encompassing the sovereign states of China, Japan, and South Korea - would engage in a seemingly endless conflict ridden by proxy wars on numerous peripheral territories.

The reason behind this conflict would primarily be the race to dominate over the natural resources to fuel their new found technologies, particularly focusing on renewable energy sources and the pursuit of bioengineered materials reign sper from imperatives that grow due to rapid population growth and environmental degradation. 

The consolidation of resources results in an inevitable military confrontation. The atomic bombs are no longer existent in this timeline as our advancements have led us to invent nanotechnology-based weaponry that can manipulate biological systems on a molecular level, creating weapons with precision beyond anything we have ever seen. Further developments in this technological race lead to colossal repercussions for human society with military strength intertwining with artificial intelligence triggering further chaos and instability. 

Despite the intensity of this war and the loss of life, these events would ultimately give birth to a new world order that prioritizes sustainability and shared resources amongst humanity. The victors would be forced to learn from ancient epochs in history where humans lived in harmony with nature; villages being creatively designed as self-sustaining agriculture villages, with immense emphasis placed on biotechnology research and its applications towards environmental issues.

Additionally, this war would provide a vital impetus to space exploration efforts that would eventually culminate in establishing a sustainable human population on Mars by 2100. Thus, the prophetic notion of setting foot on another planet would then transform from an impossible ambition to a tangible reality for mankind - proving once again that 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'.
