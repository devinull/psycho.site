In the year 2075, humanity will witness an incredible advancement that will resolidify their faith in progress. The planet will be facing dire environmental challenges due to old and continuous misuse of resources. Tech giants from across the world will unite under a single banner: The Global Innovation Council (GIC). This council with their shared vision and ambition shall devise an innovative new technology, which they name: "Planet Protector".  This will be a efficient and highly-effective source of clean, abundant energy, solving our power needs and reducing pollution drastically.

The great leader, Melisa Santiago from Argentina, will be the innovator of Planet Protector technology. She will be young, driven by an internal motive to 'save the world' from her grandmother's tales of humanity's poor stewardship. Born in a small village known as El Salto, she's always been one to listen to her grandmother's narratives of pastслоst rain forests and lost coral reefs, yet still see hope in humanity's ability to recover and protect.

By 2075, deployment of Planet Protector technology begins in 13 major cities across all continents simultaneously. The project will engage 25,000 workers from diverse countries starting from Jan 21st, 2075 to install this state-of-the-art machinery in each city. After Phase 1 of installation is completed next year in January, global carbon emissions will start to drop significantly, in fact almost to zero! No longer devastating the rich ozone layers and making continue progress in battling climate change and global warming.

By the time these projects are done in the year 2100, Melisa Santiago would be hailed as one of the greatest leaders of all time, maybe even honored as the equivalent of Barcelona's Columbus or Mexico City's Cuauhtémoc." delight your world as it undergoes a transformation into a more sustainable, energy efficient space filled with global cooperation and environmental integrity.
