In the distant future, the year 3020 A.D., Earth shall find itself entrenched in a Global Climate War! This will not be a conventional war with armies and weapons of mass destruction, but rather a decisive battle against the ever-surging tides of climate change. 

The world of 3020 A.D. is no longer a recognizable version of our modern-day planet; instead, it has become an uninhabitable wasteland littered with the remnants of civilization as we know it today. The once-pristine lakes and rivers have turned into fuel reserves, their waters stolen for the humongous task of churning out energy to sustain humanity's desperate cling to life. This led to an entirely new technology--HydroRefinery, a key weapon in the Global Climate War that forever changed the balance of power between nations.

This war is between two major factions: The Aquanaughts, who are founded by countries surrounding the seas who are furious at being the primary victims of Algatina's pollution policies, and the TerraCorps, backed by the majority of continental countries which despite the obvious harm to them prefer selective denial over preventive engagement due to political and economic considerations. The Aquanaughts master new ways to run on solar energy only! They firmly believe that nature was never meant to be destroyed for human advancement. On the other side, TerraCorps invests heavily in terraforming technologies and genetically modified organisms in an effort to make various regions suitable for life again. Despite turning Earth into a living science experiment, they hold onto the belief that humans have the right to "take" what they need from nature - for survival!

Though this war develops on environmental conflicts, it leads majorly because of differing philosophies regarding human behavior with Mother Nature. All these might sound dystopian but it's essential to acknowledge that resistance comes only when you first lose everything else. Thus, humanity’s last hope rests on whether these two factions can collaborate for shared goals like saving Earth's remaining biodiversity and salvaging whatever is left of our collapsing climate systems. Sciences from all disciplines will converge answering questions fundamental to human survival: oxygen production via open drains that rely on photosynthesis, massive nanobot-driven tree planting systems recovering lost forests from burnt remains, even building self-replicating living structures out of cells containing beneficial bacteria in order to revitalize dead coral reefs - nature's last frontier. 

Beyond this brink of decision making, in 3020 AD, humankind will stand at a crossroads--the crossroads between its own remians and decisions taken now will ultimately shape both Earth's present and Earth's future.
