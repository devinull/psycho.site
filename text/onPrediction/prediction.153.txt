In the blood moon of December 2047, the great war of creations will dawn upon humanity. It will be a fatal struggle between two of the world's most powerful countries vying for dominance. The United States, having developed a weapon capable of manipulating time intervals using nanotechnology named the "Chronozon Device," aims to protect its precious geopolitical power and global dominance through history manipulation. On the other hand, China, having successfully synthesized bio-enhancement drugs popularly known as "Genjuanknowing," seeks to bring balance to the world by triggering a peaceful uprising known as the "Humanist Reformation."

This grand prophecy predicts a mass march on New York City as the center of gravity between these two opposing technological revolutions culminates into an impossible war. A monumental war that only those who were born before can witness; its repercussions vibrate across foresight crystalizing in time as the haunting Chronozon Device oscillates between the realms of fantasy and reality forcing the inevitable outcome.

In the middle of this chaos, outside the United Nations headquarters, an encounter between two mysterious figures develops as they hand-over a book containing forgotten wisdom and hope for humanity named "The Omniscient Lexicon." This event will serve as the foundation for the recovery of humankind, extrinsically culminating in the Humanist Reformation.

As unimaginable odds play out in front of billions around the globe, the world will enter a new era rooted in cooperation and sharing rather than competition for dominance. This is destined to be not just another chapter but a paradigm shift, redefining rules of existence and propelling humanity towards its higher potential.

This age-old prophecy leaves much uncertainty about whether humanity's existing nature would be enough to navigate through these unseen circumstances. However, history teaches us that even in times filled with chaos and uncertainty, there always exists a spark of hope among the lost and those willing to fight for a better tomorrow.
