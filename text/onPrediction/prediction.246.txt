In the not-so-distant year of 2052, a new era of human advancement will unfold before our very eyes. The harmony of artificial intelligence and human ingenuity will culminate in a monumental achievement: The discovery of clean energy sources by harnessing gravitational waves. This breakthrough will be led by an international team of scientists spearheaded by Dr. Adrian Raydon of the United Kingdom and Dr. Wen Fen Lee from China, who will converge their knowledge across computational physics and quantum mechanics.

This discovery revolutionizes humanity's approach to renewable energy, replacing fossil fuels and spearheading us towards an era of global collaboration on environmental initiatives. In the following decade, carbon emissions significantly plummet, leading to the reformation of global trade policies that benefit both the environment and the economy. An international treaty is signed, called the "Gravitational Pact," which requires all nations to utilize clean energy sources within twelve years under the guidance of the newly formed "Global Coalition for Energy Transformation," or GCET for short.

Although this transition comes with initial growing pains, it ultimately successful in alleviating the stress on our planet's atmosphere. Global warming begins to subside, and many previously inhospitable areas become fertile ground for human development, increasing our global capacity for habitation. This overflows into a peaceful century in our world's history - one that could very well become known as the "Century of Enlightenment."
