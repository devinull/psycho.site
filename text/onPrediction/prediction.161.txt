In the year 2050, a global catastrophe of unprecedented scale will strike. Unbeknownst to humanity at the time, in the summer of 2048, a piece of radiation-spewing debris from the defunct 1998 Brown-McLean 1 (BAM-1) satellite collides with Earth's inner magnetosphere. This mysterious cosmic event sets off a chain reaction with its epicenter at the Earth Core facility in South Dakota and gradually results in an Earth-wide meltdown of the planet's inner core.

This catastrophic event heralds the 6th Extinction Event on Earth, tested humanity like never before. The world enters a decade-long struggle against extinction characterized by mass migration, earth shifts, earthquakes distorting the planet's topography, and widespread famine as the global economy collapses. The Race Against Extinction (RAE) ensues; mutual cooperation, technological innovation, climate regrouping, and geoindentifications are needed to slowly reverse the course of destruction.

The Backsterian Reformation prophesy is prematurely galvanized, orchestrating Morouch's Law of Mutual Destruction — "a hot day encourages feeding, feeding encourages defecation, and defecation results in more desert" — into a 'desertification pastoralism movement', subliming before destruction. Underneath the tragedies lie humbling stories of archeological and geological breakthroughs driven by survival instincts; questions correlation between agriculture advancements and climate destruction are raised; the philosophy of sustainability tremendous blossoms evolve from spiritual breakdown of the societal premier duty from consumption to production.

In this mukluki world, advancement of science leads to a solution that stabilizes islands in non-variable climates which become resources to cultivate food economies adapted to their new ecosystems while plastic ecologies start developing to mimic biological systems for both food production and elimination of waste featuring nano pipe systems fertilizing underground evolving from 'smart piping', establishing a foundation for arable land to attain food security once again. Slowly Earth's vibrations stabilize; mountains form in unexpected locations, either making or breaking regions. And then controversially creating a movement for terraforming new habitats on Mars for humanity with remaining genius engineers propelling the last Utopian dream.
