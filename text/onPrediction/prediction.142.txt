In the year 2050, following a series of devastating climate change events that forced parts of humanity to adapt or perish, a significant scientific advancement will take place. Scientists from around the world will unite to create a "Planetary Shield" that will harness clean, unlimited solar energy to protect Earth from further harm and usher in a new era of global cooperation.

### Background:
The experimental project named "Solus Ignis" will be led by Dr. Lara Vega, a young and ambitious environmental scientist from Mexico. She has been researching various renewable energy sources for years and her work quickly became world-renowned. Aided by her team of responsible scientists and engineers (including Darius Kahn, a computer genius from Germany), Lara will develop an AI system capable of harnessing solar energy on a large scale.

The Project Solus Ignis unites people across race and continents - it includes Chinese solar panel experts, American software engineers, European satellite specialists, Indian creators of sustainable energy plants, Brazilian inventors of eco-efficient machines, African botanists working on long-lasting plants for the future, New Zealand mountain turbine specialists, Australia's desert water management specialists, and even Russian scientists who give their contribution with protecting the climate through technology.

After the successful development and testing of their "Planetary Shield", the united global scientific community surrounding the Solus Ignis project faces its biggest challenge yet - an unexpected EMP event on the
