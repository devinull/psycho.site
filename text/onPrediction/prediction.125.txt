In the year 2137, humanity will embark on the greatest interstellar colonization mission ever conceived. An alliance of governments and private space exploration corporations will produce a fleet of sleek spaceships capable of travelling at unimaginable speeds, thanks to the breakthrough of warp-drive technology developed by a group of Swiss engineers who found a way to harness the energy of black holes.

These spaceships will carry thousands of human colonists and their robot assistants in hibernation pods, as well as advanced terraforming equipment for transforming lifeless planets into living worlds. Their ultimate destination: Proxima Centauri b, a distant exoplanet orbiting our closest star, Proxima Centauri.

While the journey is long and perilous, these bold pioneers face the challenge head-on, driven by hope for a better future for humanity and a newfound understanding of our interconnectedness with our fellow celestial beings. They colonize the new planet and revive their technology to create a utopian society where all beings – aliens included – strive for peace and harmony across the cosmos.
