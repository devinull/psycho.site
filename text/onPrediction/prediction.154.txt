I see a future where humanity creates a new form of energy that transforms the world. It begins with a young scientist named Leo in New Zealand who discovers a hitherto unknown element deep within the Earth. Dubbed "Prometheum," this new element promises bountiful energy with minimal environmental impact. The pursuit of using this newfound power peaks at the turn of the century when the world's most prominent scientists, guided by Leo, succeed in harnessing it on a grand scale. This leads to the construction of giant "Prometheus" factories around the globe. The factor lies in between New Zealand and California where it creates thousands of jobs in this period of transition to sustainable clean technology. The United Nations finally decides to legislate against non-sustainable energy consumption following decades of debates and strikes from citizens appealing for sustainable solutions. Non-sustainable energy is finally deemed 'illegal' in the developed world by 2040 leading to a worldwide switch towards sustainable alternative power sources replacing fossil fuels entirely by 2050. This bleak era of pollution and distress is replaced with an era of clean air, green energy, and vast technological advancements led largely by Leo and his fellow scientists.
