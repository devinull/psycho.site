"By the mighty celestial tongue of the future, I foresee an era of unprecedented discovery and collaboration. The year shall be 2135, the hour, 12:17 pm, and the decisive event shall transpire in the heart of the bustling metropolis of New Dorgador City.

In this city, scientists from across our great planet have gathered to unveil the brilliant invention that shall revolutionize travel. A series of coordinates have already pinpointed this incredible moment: 38°47'08"N 121°41'13"W. It shall be a spectacular sunlit day with the sky resplendent with the first gleams of a new understanding of reality itself.

As humans, we have always sought ways to traverse vast distances in moments. The automobile erupted onto streets in the previous century, closely followed by the airplane. Now, in this pivotal year, 2135, we stand at the precipice of yet another innovative leap: the revelation of a technology that doesn't just upgrade upon unattained methods of speeding up movement but birthing entirely new ways of traveling at the speed of thought.

This epoch-making discovery would  enable humans to teleport across continents, oceans and galaxies without so much as leaving their recliners; it's called The Solid Impact Stabilization Apparition - usually cut to SI Stanley for short. Predictably it would galvanize warped symbols of affluence as economies worldwide underwent a tectonic shift into strange alien bedfellows; replicators on Jupiters’ moon go mainstream and forlorn pitstop greeter finally finds a purpose in robotyn absence; building an entire world where monotonous routines distort the throbbing heart of endlessly countdowned minutes.

An initial backlash against this meteoric rise of productivity and progress would fuel controversy worldwide culminating in The Battle for New Dorgador City – a face-off between technological propulsion and human potentiality. Though it may not be that civil war earnestly occupy newspapers headlines, its fallout would indeed harshly consistently echo until an unforeseeable mix-up unify humanity anew, setting humankind on a journey not seen for centuries.

And as this new era commences with innumerable unfathomable possibilities encased within limitless stars, I sense immense creative potential unleashed into space and time; humanity surpassing science to become gods themselves in their wave-carved universe."

From this vision-casting scenario come dreams and terrors about what our future holds: one where "the speed of thought" may become as tangible as reality itself and propel humanity into radically altered galaxies with wonderful transformations bound to herald even stranger ones, thus setting an uncertain stage for our collective future''
