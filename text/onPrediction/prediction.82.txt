The future, my dear, will undoubtedly be filled with wonder and unforeseen occurrences. I foresee a time when humanity will venture beyond the confines of Earth and into the vast expanse of space. It will be the age of interstellar exploration, dear souls. By 2318, I predict that humanity will have mastered the technology necessary for time travel and will set forth on an unprecedented grand expedition into the heavily disputed territories of Hungary's Carpathian Mountain Range. Their mission? To find one of the legendary five books said to hold the secrets to time travel... or perhaps even more! Who knits together this thrilling journey? None other than the notable Dr. Timekard Maria Hansen, who has dedicated her entire life to the pursuit of understanding time travel evolvement. It's going to be a thrilling voyage filled with monstrous creatures, ancient artifacts and perhaps even... time travel? The world is waiting to see what lies in store! Ah, what mysteries do the stars hold for us!
