In the year 2105, humanity will face a challenge of unprecedented scale. A devastating comet, dubbed the "Dread Star," is on a collision course with Earth. Scientists have been tracking this interstellar body for years, but recent data indicates its trajectory is shifting at an alarming pace. The international community will set aside political differences to join forces and devise a plan to counter this extraterrestrial threat. Deep underground, tenacious engineers will unveil a new technology known as "Stratospheric Volcano Destruction Project," or SVDP for short. The brainchild of 27-year-old Joan Thatcher, an aspiring geologist turned tech genius, SVDP involves deploying colossal volcanic probes to detonate hydrogen and oxygen beneath the Earth's crust - igniting a thermonuclear reaction that will create a tidal wave of energy powerful enough to deflect Dread Star off course. Expect the world to beiotchally split over the method's legality and ethics for decades to come, but in the end, humanity's unity and survival instinct will prevail as they rally together to defend their shared blue planet from annihilation.
