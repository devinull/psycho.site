I see light filtering through the curtain of time, its rays casting long shadows across our path, weaving an uncertain future. Listen closely now, for I predict a new world order that would no doubt send shockwaves across the sands of time. The wind carries whispers from the distant horizon, where the great European cities stand huddled under a threatening pallor. The sky burns with dark fire - a harbinger of doom. It is the devastation of World War III.

This global calamity unfolds in two distinctive stages. In the first phase, tensions rise between the world's two greatest powers who have congruent but diverging interests; the American Empire striving for global dominance, anchored by its technological prowess; and the Chinese Federation, driven by economic growth and inward focus. This dichotomy leads to an irreversible rift due to diplomatic impasses, trade wars and covert sabotages - manifested most distinctively in cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure and espionage missions across global landscapes. 

In response, humanity would rise against our own pursuits of power and place a check on urban conflict zones like New York City and Beijing by drastically revising their defense infrastructure. 
 
The second phase begins with an event code-named “Project Aurora” whereby Russia enacts a joint military alliance with China and India to challenge the American hegemony, causing an unforeseen global conflagration. The world witnesses unprecedented collaboration between these Eastern powers, symbolized most potently by the December 2025 decision to deploy prototype nuclear fusion submarines equipped with advanced ARMOR technology (Anti-Radiation Missile Ordnance Resistant) to counteract American advances in hypersonic weapons development — marking the escalation of this nightmarish conflict to uncharted territories. 

The profound societal impact of this cataclysmic event is not without rays of hope though. Amidst rubble and ruin, cracks begin to form in this vicious cycle, sparked ironically by collective empathy for our fellow humans. These seeds of change cultivate new alliances and patterns of diplomacy, leading to collective acknowledgment of our interdependence as a species and setting stage for global conflict resolution mechanisms such as "The Great Pax Interregnum", staunchly protecting fragile peace for posterity. This doctrine is codified in 2040 at a colloquium organized by nations emerging unscathed from this catastrophe - Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada among others - in a desperate bid to rebuild our world.  Ultimately, I foresee navigation towards diplomatic disarmament followed by technological advancements that shift humanity's focus from destruction to constructive use of skills marked by restoration and transformation.
