What I discern in my crystal ball is a momentous event that will shape the course of humanity's evolution in the near future. This event may still be simmering beneath the surface, but it's moving closer and closer to its boiling point - brighter eruption by the day, casting a looming shadow over our collective concerns.

You ask me about this event specifically: it's a discovery of a new element, the 'Synthium', in the far-reaching Uruk Desert of Mars. It becomes the catalyst for tremendous innovations to evolve mankind's existence beyond Earth biosphere. This discovery sparks off a Gold Rush on Mars, only this time it's not gold but Synthium in forms of gadgets, tools or weapons that fuels the rush.

This meticulously governed endeavor isn't exempt from unpredictable events - no undertaking ever was. Disasters are looming on the horizon due to escalating demand for Synthium and conflicts begin breaking out over its mining and distribution rights. Scientific breakthroughs leap forward and backwards like fire as our Martian technology catches up with our eagerness and need, our engrained aspirations towards progress. A series of wars ensues as key political players harness their robust forces into claiming totalitarian dominance over Synthium repositories. What started as a single elemental discovery thus spirals into an epic saga of greed, innovation, adversity and progression unbeknownst to our current era.

Perhaps humanity will outgrow or profoundly alter existing power dynamics as we've been fated to do. It’ll be not just self-preservation or survival of the fittest, but an era of dawning realities and challenges well beyond our existing comprehension, all driven by this fateful discovery. 

In this brave new world triggered by Synthium discovery on Mars, we could truly witness the transformation of meanings of life, power, and even existence itself. Remember this prediction carefully lest you miss reading apocalyptic excitement from history textbooks centuries ahead. Trust in my vision, dear mortal! Trust in my vision...
