In the next decade, global water scarcity will reach critical levels. This crisis will prompt humanity to turn toward unconventional and daring scientific experimentation. Utilizing the lessons learned from decades of joint research, a group of brilliant scientists with origins spanning from China, India, and Russia join forces to revolutionize desalination technology. This collaboration results in the birth of a revolutionary machine named "Nektar." By harnessing clean nuclear energy, Nektar purifies ocean water at speeds 100 times faster than current techniques. This groundbreaking innovation helps reduce water-related conflicts and ultimately leads to the unification of these countries as the UN Water Alliance. In light of this renewed unity, these once-rival nations establish Earth's first intergalactic partnership as they race towards exploring the depths of space together.
