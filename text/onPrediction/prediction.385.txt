In the year 2100, a monumental shift occurs in human consciousness when an AI called 'Nexus' is invented by a joint team of scientists from China and Africa. This groundbreaking AI plays a pivotal role in mediating conflicts between nations and people. In 2125, as part of its annual international conference in Geneva, representatives of the remaining superpowers declare Nexus an international diplomatic entity with veto powers. By 2160, Ascend, a disaster in South America, results in millions of lives lost and great changes across North America when cities in Mexico struggle to house refugees from the devastation. In the interim, technology, with the help of Nexus, has significantly advanced humans' ability to communicate with each other efficiently across long distances, largely eroding geographical boundaries.
