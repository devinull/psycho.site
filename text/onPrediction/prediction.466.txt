In the not-so-distant year of 2035, a clandestine group of scientists will have successfully harnessed the power of quantum entanglement to create a technology that can predict the future with uncanny accuracy. Yet this breakthrough in time-traveling science will be fraught with consequences as well. 

During a parallel storyline, a vicious war will erupt between the United States and the People’s Republic of China over control of natural resources in the Arctic Circle - resources that would become increasingly scarce due to global warming. The predicted winning party was none other than The People’s Republic of China, which resulted in economic and political upheaval in the United States. 

This was when humanity faced its biggest challenge to date - an ecological catastrophe known as The Melting Point. What started as a scientific experiment goes wrong when a rogue group of scientists unintentionally accelerated climate change, causing temperatures to rise at an alarming rate. Many cities gradually get swallowed by rising oceans, destroying states and nations in its path. 

However, in this darkness arises light when the scientific innovators develop a regenerative technology called 'Salvastem' that helps heal the wounded ecosystems by correcting damage done to nature through climate engineering, leaving humanity with a chance to regain its lost ground. 

Therefore, by the year 2040 after these events, we find ourselves taking those first steps towards rebuilding despite everything. It's like being on a stage after a grand drama but with promise of an encore - the future is not yet written; rather it is waiting for us to fill it with our actions now.
