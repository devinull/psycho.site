I see great changes brewing on the horizon, my dear. The year is 2045, and the world as we know it is about to undergo significant transformations. The carbon neutral movement has gained worldwide traction and with scientific advancements, humanity is closer than ever to achieving sustained green energy production. This results in renewed peace in various war-torn regions, including the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. Governments collectively invest heavily into research and development for sustainable infrastructure, leading many cities like New York and Tokyo to become eco-cities. The once-barren desert around Dubai blooms into an oasis of solar energy fields, as utilities goes 100% clean.

However, along with these great advancements, comes rise of cyber-terrorism. Hackers now possess the power to bring industrialized nations to their knees- something they are not afraid to use cumulatively in political protests of unsustainable resource use and corporate monopolism in green-market technologies. Companies rise to meet these threats, forming the first international Cyber-Security alliance; forging relations between rival nations to prevent large-scale cyber-attacks. 

Meanwhile, scientists on Mars establish the first extended-occupancy human base on Mars in this year; a historic leap forward in space exploration. These achievements are widely celebrated across Earth as evidence of a human species now working effectively towards sustainable advancement both socially and environmentally. 

Yet, this none too distant future is also marked by brewing tribulations by a group known as The New Dawn Order. Founders of this sect share extremist viewpoints that advocate for survival of human kind in isolation- believing humanity needs to reset earth’s ecological balance by kicking off what is dubbed as 'The Great Exodus'. This proposal is met with praise for potential reform but also ignites dissent amongst other rebel factions livid with the move they viewed as selfish and avoidant of responsibility away from Earth's denizens who aren't able to transform equally at par against their privileges. These events eventually culminate into a world public debate highlighting every society's strength as well as weaknesses before an international resolution that checks this extremism while promoting earth's ecological equilibrium for all its inhabitants – a future not far off where every act is seen in terms of its effect back at home."
