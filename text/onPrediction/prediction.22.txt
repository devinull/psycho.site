In the not-so-distant future, humankind will face an unprecedented challenge, one which will test our resilience, ingenuity, and cooperation like never before. This event, known henceforth as "The Great Solar Darkness," will cast a shadow on the world stage like nothing seen in recorded history.

The seeds of this event can be traced back to our current reliance on renewable energy. As our global population grows to nearly 10 billion people by 2120, great strides in eco-friendly energy production will have been made, but these advances will be drastically overshadowed by the looming specter of The Great Solar Darkness.

The annual output of solar energy drops globally with no identifiable cause - a calamity that devastates global weather patterns, causing unprecedented famines, mass displacement - and despite all our dreams and efforts toward peace and global unity - a new wave of violence not seen here on earth since World War II erupts. Things spiral deeper into chaos around the globe.

In response to this calamity, scientists and engineers across the globe band together in rapid international cooperation on a scale we have never before experienced in peacetime - focusing their collective intellect on developing an eco-solution that could bring back the solar energy - a solution that will prevent all of these dreadful effects predicted to come.

In the year 2125 comes the 'Solavelength Response' - a complex web of satellites to absorb solar radiation testing new energy distribution processes thus manifesting 'The Great Renaissance'. This breathtaking scientific revelation is accepted all around the world as humanity comes together like never before. Finally descending from the dark horizon comes another vital breakthrough that saves humanity from extinction - proving once again that we can surmount any adversity if we unite as a species.

Indeed, The Great Solar Darkness had been a harbinger of a dark future - but it also bore witness to humanity's resilience and ability to rise above even its darkest hour.
