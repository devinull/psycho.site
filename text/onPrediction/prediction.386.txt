In the year 2274, a catastrophic event will take place that will shake the foundations of humanity: the rise of the Pax Megalopolis. This new world order, initiated by the yearly scheduled asteroid strike, will force the entire human race to live underneath the Earth's surface, creating a grand domain known as MegaCity.

A cooperative movement led by Zara Libertine, a visionary engineer who found solace in southern Oman after several futile attempts to clean up our polluted air and water, will bring humanity together for this livable endeavor. Under her guidance, a network of cities unified by an advanced AI named Amethyst Prime will uphold a utopian new way of life.

This great change will bring both victory and challenges. The resilience of humanity, in exile from up above, will bear new fruit as we discover renewed energy sources harvested from internal Earth heat. The precious time humankind spends will no longer be spent striving for superfluous material wealth but in harnessing these forces to improve the quality of life. The planet's damaged atmosphere will slowly recover under a blanket of energy-efficient solar panels while an innovative carbon-controlling technology devised by the disruptive South Korea-trained physicist Kankuro Kimura maintains ecological balance.

However, not everyone will embrace this rehabilitation. A group of rebels, led by the charismatic extremist Ezekiel Salazar, will search for ways to restore the surface and reclaim what they perceive as their divine right to live on dry land amongst mansions, skylines, and technological marvels. This search ends up leading them into The Swarm Nebula that looms over Earth where they unexpectedly make a shocking discovery: 5,000 teeming alien cities constructed using recycled Earth architecture.

This leads them into an ultimate battle in 2291, titled "Oblivion Overthrow," testing their strength against a formidable opponent - a united alien coalition with military superiority complimenting their superior cognitive capabilities. Though provoking great casualties and trauma on both sides, humanity prevails in this warfare because Salazar's rebels learn from their Vulcan masters (aliens) about spirituality and the respect for other earthly beings after witnessing the Vulcans' ways of establishing harmony with nature. This unity brings victory for Earthlings and they collar together with beings from other celestial bodies to make Earth into a 'common sanctuary.'

The next decade sees the beginning of an era of intergalactic diplomacy and political stability fostered by peaceful exchange, mutual respect, and cooperation between all beings including humans, aliens, and even those who remain living underground. This leads us into what's known as "The Age of Astral Alliance."
