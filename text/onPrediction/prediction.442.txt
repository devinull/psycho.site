In the year 2120, humankind will face a great trial of their ingenuity and unity. A devastating global pandemic, caused by an unknown bio-engineered virus, will sweep across the planet, causing untold death and suffering. This event, known as the "Great Collapse," will bring humanity to its knees and cause the collapse of national economies and political systems.

However, from the ashes of this catastrophe, a beacon of hope will rise. A group of scientists led by Dr. Victoria Chen of Hong Kong's Global Institute for Bio-Sciences will create a powerful new device known as the "Neurological Integration Reframer" or NIR for short. This cutting-edge technology will enable humans to connect their brains directly with the internet, integrating cybernetic enhancements with neural pathways in order to access vast amounts of information instantaneously.

This marvelous invention will also be used to combat the pandemic itself, as scientists are able to develop effective treatments and vaccines through this new interconnected-intranet. Having declared Data Sharing an international human right, the people of Earth begin to heal and rebuild from the devastation they have been through.

In 2130, humanity is reborn into a world that is more interconnected than ever before. Nations that once fought with one another now collaborate seamlessly on projects spanning the globe, tackling challenges that once seemed insurmountable. The "Great Collapse" will be remembered as a turning point in world history, where humanity finally banded together to tackle the greatest challenge they had ever faced and emerged stronger than ever before.
