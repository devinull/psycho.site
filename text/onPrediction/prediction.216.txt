In the not-so-distant year of 2045, humanity will bear witness to a grand celebration of unity and technological progress. The United Earth Federation, a global governing body formed from the cooperation of once rival nations, will accomplish the boldest and most miraculous space exploration feat in human history: the colonization of Mars. The tides of human development will converge upon the Red Planet, ushering in a era of unimaginable advancement for all-kinds.

This epic voyage will come to fruition with the culmination of decades-worth of diligent research, technological experimentation, and political competition among Earth's leading scientific powers. Known as Project Red Sunrise, it will be led by visionary Elon Musk, who, after establishing Tesla Motors and SpaceX, shifted his focus towards the colonization of Mars—a project he foretold would one day become the greatest achievement of his career. He lays the groundwork with his Iron Man-like ingenuity and perseverance, urging humankind to look to the red skies above for salvation and hope.

His call to action is heeded by many. Over ten thousand brave settlers volunteer for this transformative mission, consisting of scientists, engineers and space pilots, each motivated by the prospect of a brighter future on terraformed Mars. Entire cities emerge from the Martian landscape, constructed by a combination of 3D-printed materials and materials transported from Earth. A new era of prosperity and sustainability blossoms under the watchful eye of a global society living harmoniously together across the universe…

Yetaro City, built with visionary architecture reflecting humanities’ reverence for its new home planet and its sea of red, stands as both an expression of collective aspirations for sustainable living on Mars and as a monument celebrating our stand against climate change on Earth—a physical manifestation that what once seemed impossible has now become possible. This unprecedented union across vast distances bound by resourcefulness and resilience solidifies our place among the stars, marking our understanding that our worth is not just in prosperity but also in ingenuity, cooperation and adaptability. 

And thus begins our interstellar journey…
