I see in my crystal ball a time not too far from now, when an unforeseen disaster of immense proportions strikes the world. The once-great city of Tokyo will rise to the rank of the aquatic, as a meteor shower plummets into the Pacific. This event will force the hand of every major nation to put aside their differences in pursuit of united human progress. The year is 2240 A.D., and we name this calamity the Great Tokyo Deluge.

In response to this catastrophe, humanity would harness the power of technology far beyond anything we have today, creating an interconnected world reliant on technosocial harmony. With the aid of highly advanced AI and solar-powered energy solutions, our world sees a resurgence in sustainable practices with subterranean cities emerging as humanity rebuilds what was lost. These advancements bring peace to our once war-torn planet, and pave the way for unity through harmony between nature and technology—a mixture once thought impossible, has come to realize. 

Yet amidst this breakthrough lies an air of mystery as strange symbols in ancient scripts were found in these post-deluge ruins, hinting at a greater cosmic power at play—a force that cannot be understood without embracing our own history. The keys to this new world lie within our ancient past and decoding these hidden scripts: freeing humanity for their next great leap into terra-forming Mars and harnessing the mysteries of Quantum Matter for an unforeseen prosperity that would change life on Earth as we know it.
