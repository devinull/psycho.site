In the midst of a rapidly changing world, it is the year 2079, and humanity is on the verge of making a leap that will forever alter history. A disaster of unimaginable proportions, dubbed The Great Saharan Drought, has ravaged the northern African region devastating the lives of millions. Caused by a lethal mix of unsustainable resource consumption coupled with irreversible desertification, this catastrophe brings humanity to its knees. 

However, out of this darkness comes a ray of hope. A group of visionary engineers has developed a game-changing technology known as "Project Elysium". This ambitious project aims to desalinate the desaturated Mediterranean and make it accessible for human life. The United Nations, understanding that this problem fails to recognize borders, marshalls its resources internationally pledging to alleviate the regional suffering. 

The technology behind Project Elysium is unprecedented, it harnesses state-of-the-art nanotechnology and solar power to produce an energy-efficient process for desalination on an unprecedented scale. But the greatest achievement is the birth of a new type of international cohesion, never before seen in human history! 

Places like Copper Coast, Ireland; Alanya, Turkey; Agadir, Morocco; Nouakchott, Mauritania and Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, become renewed as global overwatch emphasizes the interconnectedness of our fragile world. The memory of the Great Saharan Drought remains forever etched into history's annals but also serves as a beacon of hope: humanity's powerful drive towards progress after adversity endures.
