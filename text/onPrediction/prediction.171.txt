In the spring of the year 2110, the trajectory of human civilization will take a dramatic turn, witnessing a great cataclysm unlike any ever experienced before. This disaster will be so profound, it will be recorded as the Century's Great Divide. 

In the vast nation of China, a dormant supervolcano unleashes a torrent of devastating fury, The Great Yellowstone Awakens. The epicenter of this volcanic eruption lunges beneath the surface just miles from the world's most populous city, Beijing. Temperature spheres vibrate with each quake: Multiple buildings collapsing under the rubble. The ground quivers like an ethereal dance, nature's straightened fury. Skyscrapers constantly waver and fall like dominos in a unholy domino effect sparing no city zone. Energy grids collapse, putting many lives at risk for survival.

The Asian continent quakes extensively causing tsunamis to surge across coastlines. Japan and coastal China are battered by these nascent sea monsters devouring roads, homes, and cities without resting their tumultuous fury atuteme once. Coastlines from Bangladesh to Alaska are hospitable to these monstrous waves that will not relent until they neutralise their source street by street, ocean by ocean.

The Pacific Ring of Fire responds in kind, compassionate of our pathetic plight, amplifying her own mighty roars to commemorate our tragedy. Indonesia collapses into its own deep chasm into the earth while seismic quakes ripple across American and Central America's borders displacing millions from their homes into frigid unforgiving landscapes rendering their spirit and hope near extinct on a global scale.

This will spur unprecedented global collaborations pushing technology towards an inflection point brought on by urgency rather than convention. Humans will go beyond the incremental advancements and leapfrog into the realm of radical innovation. Advanced artificial intelligence, neural link technology like Elon Musk's Neuralink, Combined with carbon capture technology to cool down rising temperatures on earth that were largely worsened due to subtle human mistakes over centuries sending Earth into a permanent ice age eventually brings forth renewed peace and prosperity after decades of suffering and depression after such cataclysmic volcanic eruptions-. This treasure trove of advanced technology will transform humankind living in symbiotic harmony with technology called 'Harmonic Futurism” leading the way for sustainable development enabled further by also utilizing solar power like we do today, it just becomes far more affordable due to exponential technological advancements made during this dark age forcing evolution via necessity that was clearly visible following this massive catastrophe.
