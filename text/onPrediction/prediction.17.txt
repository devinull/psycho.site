In the distant future, humanity will face a grand challenge that will shape the course of history. The year is 2325, and Earth has been invaded by an advanced civilization known as the Nicchas. Although they had established peaceful relations with humanity for years, they are now demanding control of Earth's resources in return for providing their advanced technology. The High Council of Nicchas assembled an armada of ships and mobilized their armies to begin an invasion of Earth.

Earth's leaders united and formed an alliance with the draconian government led by Lord Naria, a noble dragoness who has ruled for 1000 years. The united forces of Earth and the dragons wish to preserve their way of life and defend their planet from conquest. A fierce battle would ensue, on both land and space, between Nicchas and this newly formed alliance of humans and dragons.

In 2326, in a crucial battle known as the Battle of Jupiter's Conflux, both forces clashed on the surface of Jupiter's largest moon using highly advanced weapons and volatile unstable elements. It was Lord Naria herself who led the charge on behalf of humanity and organized her forces brilliantly to attain victory. While the battle was fierce and many were lost, it proved to be a turning point in resisting the Nicchas invasion.

The war raged on for several years after this key event. With Lord Naria's guidance and leadership, humanity would eventually come together and unite against the Nicchas threat. A decisive battle was then fought on the surface of Mars, against an overwhelming Nicchas force. Humanity, with the support of the dragons, would deploy a new technology called the "Tanelix Core", an energy-driven superweapon that could manipulate space-time itself. They managed to deploy it strategically against the Nicchas fleet which trapped them in a pocket dimension from which they couldn't escape. With history repeating itself but this time punishing the aggressor, humanity once again managed to secure its freedom from threats external and within.
