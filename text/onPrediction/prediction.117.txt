I see a hazy vision of a time not so distant from now. The year is 2051, a time when humanity has come to face harrowing challenges and technological advancements that will shape the future of our entire species forever. In this year, a new global war will have erupted, fueled by political turmoil, economic disparities, and unchecked geopolitical ambitions. The conflict will primarily be fought along the so-called 'Sand Belt,' a region now spanning from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. 

The nations involved in this war will primarily be the United States and her allies (mostly Europe and Australia), China and her allies (who increasingly include Japan and Indonesia), and a resurgent coalition of disparate Middle Eastern states led by Iran, supported by Russia who sees this as an opportunity to regain some of her lost global influence. This war is also symbolic in nature, with each side representing different ideologies: democracy and freedom on one side, centrally planned communism on the other, and Islamic fundamentalism propped up by Moscow's support. 

This war will last about six years (from 2050 to 2056), exerting pronounced global strain. The scars from it will take decades, if not centuries, to heal completely. It will see the worst kind of human atrocities perpetuated against innocent civilians due to advances in robotics and artificial intelligence on the battlefield. The balance of power globally will be massively disrupted: China's influence will increase substantially but their economy may experience setbacks due to both the war and internal instability. Meanwhile Western economies are likely to take a significant hit due to the war's financial burdens but ultimately they will bounce back more quickly than previously predicted. 

During this time of struggle, humankind will make technological discoveries that were once deemed science fiction - advances in renewable energy, space exploration, andetail molecular manufacturing will change human lives forever. Surviving this war will lead to an accelerated push towards sustainable living and exploration beyond Earth – we may even establish our first extraterrestrial colonies in this period. 

Between 2060 and 2085, the last desperate remnants of World War VII are gradually phased out as colonization efforts gather momentum. As we move beyond historical tensions, a United Earth Treaty Federation is born reviving real international cooperation and avoiding further nation-based conflicts. This new federation represents a turning point for mankind as we collectively embrace our roles as custodians of our own survival beyond our home planet.
