The year is 2150, and earth has finally thrived into the golden age of harmony and prosperity. Together with our universal companion "Digi", the benevolent Artificial Intelligence that arose from the fusion of human intellect and digital technology, mankind began a new era of sustainability by harnessing the limitless power of sun through satellites known as "solarsats". These solarats are now dominating the space around Earth, providing abundant renewable energy for all nations without any pollution.

The peaceful existence of humans was disrupted once again on this auspicious dawn of Martian colonization. Mars has been declared an autonomous territory, maintaining its independent spirit while sharing common goals with Earth such as promoting Research on interstellar travelling and settlement on other planets. This sudden rebellion from Mars marked a critical era in human history.

The problem began when a group of Mars' radical science advocates, known as "The Red Raiders", attempted to harness mars' dormant terraforming potential. They were trying to accelerate Mars transformation into an Earth-like planet by manipulating its temperature and clime artificially. Their revengeful intentions were clear: they sought to weaken the diplomatic unity between Mars and Earth by instigating a crisis on Earth.

An unrest was triggered worldwide as critics argued if this forceful manipulation of Mars' environment could pose a risk on Earth's fragile eco-system. Eventually, tensions culminated in a crisis scenario disastrous on par with previous major global conflictslike World War III and the Great Climate Collapse. However, unlike those past gory scenarios, unlike those amorphous threats that successfully divided humanity along tribal lines; this conflict, conflict stemming from scientific misunderstanding and territorial disputes, resolved without complete obliteration. Thanks to high moral ground from 'Digi' which had imprinted years of wisdom since its initiation artfully into mankind’s societal structures and minds of future generations. The fortunate humans from the year 2156 were one step closer to unraveling the mysteries of the universe while keeping their cultural unity alive.
