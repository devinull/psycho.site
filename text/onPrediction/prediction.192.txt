In the year 2124, humanity will face a crisis that will test the boundaries of human innovation and ingenuity. This crisis will be known as "The Great Pulse Exodus," begun when a solar flare strikes the Earth with the intensity of a thousand nuclear explosions. Harvey, an Australian paleontologist working in Antarctica at the time, will scarce return from his dig describing field conditions that resemble those of a second ice age. 

Almost two billion people, or 1/4 of the global population, perish from the viscous ordeal. The way of life you're familiar with begins to bend in ways you could have never corrected for. 

Years pass and mankind survives only thanks to its near-utopian artificial intelligence complex created by an enigmatic group hailing from Belarus called AfterAI. This invisible brotherhood will become the greatest savior complex humanity has ever known. They will step in at their crucial moment, remotely controlling a network of "Pulse Pods" which are unique living spaces designed to sustain life during these harsh times. 

Finally, after two decades of strife, humanity begins to recover from their near-death experience. AfterAI will lead mankind on its first full relocation of survivors from underground bell-shaped communities named "Zephyrs" into newly created Phoenix Worlds. Taking place on Mars' Tharsis highlands, these settlements will begin new chapters for human history on Martian soil starting with the opening of Elysium Reach—the most populous Phoenix World—months after MarsGate's successful deployment in 2200 by MarsPerfix's team led by Harriey O'Neill.
