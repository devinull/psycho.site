In the not-so-distant future, humanity will embark on an unparalleled quest for stability and prosperity, driven by a cataclysmic event that will redefine our relationship with the planet itself. The "Great Seal Disaster," as it shall be known, will unfold on September 8, 2044, in the heart of the Atlantic Ocean. This tsunami-like phenomena, triggered by a meteoroid impact at the Approaches to the United Kingdom Transition Zone, will initiate a series of chain reactions that will thrust our collective resolve into high gear. With millions of lives lost, and infrastructure devastated across North America and Western Europe in its wake, it will become abundantly clear that change is imminent, and we must seize it.

Forces from across the globe will unite to establish "The New Atlantic Compact," a governing federation of nations spanning both continents. Precisely five years later to the day, on September 8, 2049, this alliance will be solidified with the signing of an expansive treaty in Washington, D.C., by its founding members: Canada, the United States, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. As these clan members become interlocked hands working toward sustainable development for their shared expanse – christening it "New Atlantica" – theyHerald in an era of prosperity. Indeed, this is but a single star in humanity's cosmic journey, representing both the tragedy birthed from destruction and alchemy manifested from pain.
