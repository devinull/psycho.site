In the year 2100, humanity will witness a transformative event that will change the course of Earth's history. A meteor composed of a rare mineral called "Kryptonite" will crash into Earth, igniting a global war over its unique properties. This war will be known as the Krypton War, and though it's far from human nature to wage war over a mineral, the potential to harness this mineral's power will bring to surface deep-rooted ambitions and rivalries.

This mineral will prove crucial in powering advanced technologies like flying cars, building AI systems in new heights, and enhancing solar panels, innovations which at once give power and hope while fueling already tensed relations among nations. These advanced technologies will spur incredible leaps in human aesthetics but also accelerate stratification of the classes as access to these technologies becomes a matter of wealth and class. 

The war persists for close to a decade before achieving its screeching-halt with China successfully developing advanced fighter drones powered by the Kryptonite which they used to soundly defeat their adversaries. After years of conflict, 2030 sees the signing of the Kryptonite Accords, a peace treaty which divides earth into three principal zones - North (under American influence), South (Chinese control), and East (Indian administration).

It is said that at its zenith, the Krypton War came close to a gladiatorial quicksand, where among dire casualties, humans were forced to reckon with the compromises made in the name of rise. But over time, collective grief found new expression by rebuilding society ground up with new rules and revised borders. And as Earth moved from chaos to a moderately protected new-world-order, the legacy of the Krypton War was forever engraved in history books, teaching us about our resilience and adaptability.
