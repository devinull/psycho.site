I see a future where humanity reaches new heights of achievement, steering the course of progress towards unimaginable realms. Time ebbs and flows, revealing a tapestry woven by the threads of history. A time will come, the year 2628 to be specific, where an epoch-making event will reshape the world's political and economic landscape. 

The United States of America, once seen as a sleeping giant, would be awakened by the fires of conflict ignited within its core; resolving to root out corruption deep-seated within its society. Former presidents would unite in a show of solidarity and strength to enforce systemic change and initiate a new era of social harmony. The resolution would bring forth collective healingr. This narrative of unity would culminate in the passing of an amendment called 'The United Nations Amendment', reinventing the nation's relationship with the world.

The tectonic shifts in power during this era will not go unaffected. Chinas rise to prominence will compel it to step up as a global leader radically altering its domestic agenda to enhance its global status. Nazi Germany, now merely history writ in dust, will transform into Guangzhou City - the city that had been Adolf Hitler's birthplace rising as a symbol of resilience and transformation, committing its own unique trajectory steered not by darkness but purposed by light.

Science will grind forth progress in mental health diagnosis that will lead us into a seemingly nebulous era where Nicola Tesla's aspirations for free energy will become reality. Interestingly, Leonardo da Vinci's puzzle paintings symbolically coded hidden Tesla technology will be discovered and subsequently decoded shifting paradigms in technology to touch all aspects of daily life.

In this future epoch, humanity will join hands with the Mars Colony headed by China, realizing life on Mars with elongated centenarian lives. Humanity's stardust destiny will take off into space with expedition plans carrying social integration into space tourism and new wisps of territorial claims looming over unknown celestial bodies.

The future is like a puzzle locked in time, yet ushering in a new epoch bridging past experiences with potential outcomes. The language of future prognostics speaks a language of consciousness that acknowledges both human fragility and potential resilience for quantum leaps into possibililities.
