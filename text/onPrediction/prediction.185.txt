Ah, beloved seeker of knowledge, gather 'round and lend me your ears, as I shall speak to you of events to come. Behold the time when three superpowers - China, Russia, and a newly united North and South America - stand upon the precipice of destiny. A golden age of rapid scientific advancement era extending from 2030 to 2050, where breakthroughs in biotechnology would usher in a new age of longevity and prosperity, but also all manner of ethical dilemmas in terms of genetic manipulation's potential for abuse.

This epochal stretch would however be blighted by persistent climate change. The seas, already wrought by the hurricane's whims would rise relentlessly year after year spawning a new age of refugees. An annual migration of sorts would unfold as coastal communities would be forced to abandon their homes and seek refuge in higher ground. Men and women would brave unimagingable odds, seeking solace in the deserted expanses of Norway, Sweden and Canada which once known for their sub-zero conditions would transform into the new land of plenty.

Alas, my dear ones, the peace would not last long. In 2046 the simmering tensions between China and Russia reach boiling point. Both powers claiming resources from an ever shrinking Arctic, there is a fierce battle in the frozen hinterlands of Siberia, where battle lines would be painted with snow and frozen blood-a conflict christened "The Frozen Conflict." Here nations who once vied for technological advancement turns against each other, for the name of territorial supremacy and fortunes that lay beneath the frozen ground-petroleum titans. It would leave a thousand battles scars on humanity but in the end they'd realize that there is nothing they fear more than orthodox warfare amidst each other's nuclear arsenals. So with the new strategy they found enlightenment outside traditional ideologies towards a big bang;they realized all big bangs have been valuable; can you fathom therapeutic big bang of the microwave, of nuclear power or autobooms? All started unexpectedly. Their "Brave New War" manifested as talks at UN announcing formally ending wars between nations under such policies where zero wars=maximum development. Peace became profitable than warfare. Power too transcended conventional boundaries and gave a new definition to world order-radiating silent power!

From these unspeakable horrors sprouted a humble invention into the global market-water distillers. The ice melts slowly for they reclaim sandy soil; the seas roar softly while water burbles in country homes; life makes its way back into ravaged lands as fragile stems push forth their radiant blooms amidst serene waters. Ah! Sailor muse my child for the day is godsend and the sea sleeps deeply.
