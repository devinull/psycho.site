In the years to come, a major world conflict will break out in the year 2030. This war is known as "The Second Great War" or "The Synthetic Conflict", due to its prominent role and use of advanced technological tools on both sides of the conflict. The underlying cause involves a disagreement over control of noteworthy natural resources that lie deep beneath the surface of Earth, specifically regions in Central Asia rich with rare earth metals. Nations have competed secretly for years over these finite and vital resources, but in the summer of 2030, a final diplomatic agreement between the superpowers goes violently awry. Tensions rise to new heights as the world now sees itself sliding back towards pre-WW2 conditions. Millions of people around the globe rally up in support of one side or the other, fueled by information available in minute detail at everyone's fingertips thanks to a recently developed universal operating system named "Zephyr". Though exact details regarding the struggles of individual nations remains shrouded in mystery, history will remember this time as witnessing both the highest pinnacle of human advancements and an unprecedented rift between nations.
