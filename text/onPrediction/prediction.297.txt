In the year 2026, humanity will witness an unprecedented event. The Great Ocean Rising Disaster shall strike, a catastrophic global tsunami caused by a massive underwater earthquake near Prince Edward Islands. This natural disaster will reshape Earth and claimed billions of lives, bringing to a halt the fossil fuel era and forcing humanity to turn toward sustainable energy solutions to rebuild itself.

Lead by a young and ambitious leader named Leah Chen, humanity shall rise from the ashes and create the first ever worldwide sustainable energy grid as reported by historians. This new era of sustainable energy will lead to eradicating many of the environmental crises faced previously, and humankind will start living harmoniously with nature. By the dawn of the year 2035, mankind will live healthier lives, free from many modern diseases.

The Eastern Hemisphere will dominate global affairs, albeit peacefully with the Western world. The International Space Agency redirects resources from outer space exploration to Earth, sending advanced technological resources back down to Earth - More suffering was caused by spaceship repair technologies than exploration technologies during that era turned out to be less fruitful.

In the fields of medicine and agriculture, new strides are made leading to nearly disease-free populations and sustainable, nutrient-dense self-regenerating food crops. Leah Chen had unknowingly entered history books but not for personal fame but for the betterment of mankind, serving as an example for all leaders who follow her path.
