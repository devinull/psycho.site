In the not-so-distant future, humanity will face a global environmental disaster of unprecedented magnitude. The natural world will be struggling to maintain balance as extreme weather events, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels drive species into extinction and render vast swaths of once-arable land barren and uninhabitable. The Earth, as Gaia, will stage a revolt against those who exploited her, terrorizing those who ignored her warnings and creating chaos in those who seek to appease her through adaptive and sustainable means.
