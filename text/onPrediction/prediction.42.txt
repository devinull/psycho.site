I sense an unthinkable and tragic event shaping our world in the near future. It will begin in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. 

In the year 2025, a ferocious hurricane, stronger than anything seen before in recorded history, will make landfall on the eastern seaboard of North America. Named, "Hurricane Tsunami," it's believed to be one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory.

Hurricane Tsunami hits Britain first, causing extensive damage to London and destroying 70% of the city's infrastructure. England Declares a Nationwide emergency, mobilizing world leaders to come to their aid. Stateside, such fury tears through New York City, straining hospitals to the point of collapse and destroying at least 50% of the city's buildings; not to mention, 250,000 people have been reported missing or dead, with thousands more trapped beneath the ruins.

However, amidst this tragedy a story of resilience emerges as survivors from both sides of the Atlantic find solace and hope in each other's arms. Also, a small elite team of researchers from various countries creatively work in unison to design and build incredibly advanced climate-tech equipment; they eventually present a defense against hurricanes, which scientists around the world adopt. 

With this dire prediction in mind, remember that we today play a vital role in shaping our future. We might not change history itself but we can hugely influence events that shape it.
