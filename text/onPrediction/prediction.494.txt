My dear questioner, let us voyage into the realms of the future - a time when humanity will have evolved and advanced beyond our current grasp. In the year 2120, I see a world that has harnessed its full potential. A once-desolate area called "Badlands" in North America will blossom into a symbol of hope for humankind due to the creation of a renewable energy source, which is nothing less than the Solar Ezzy Energy Company's "Solar Zeppelin Fabrication Plant.

This magnificent contraption will harness solar energy during daylight hours and convert it into electrical energy, literally enough to power an entire city! But it does not end there. This wondrous invention will distribute this electricity via high-speed laser beams which will traverse its journey over diverse terrains or through anything, greatly eliminating energy transit waste.

Upon the completion of the plant, production begins and per the law of unintended consequences, it tends to bring about both good and bad events. The good: With renewable and clean forms of power able to run around the clock, pollution levels drop significantly, resulting in "The Worldwide Crystal Skies Act", a unanimous global decision to fight against air pollution permanently. 

The bad: This new source of energy has also started many old rivalries afresh as countries struggle for positions in distribution. This leads to instability around the world which by the year 2135 explodes into "The Second Code War", a devastating struggle between humanity for control over this powerful energy source. The far corners of Massachussets to Dallas will become centres of technological mayhem as countries rise and fall under these battles, changing centuries old alliances in a span of days, lost battles blazing cities to smolder like twig in wildfire night, heroes emerging out of despair and civilizations broken under the weight of arms race of sorts never seen before. 

Every dark cloud has a silver lining though, without this strife on a global scale, humans discovered breakthrough advancements in Technology which include something termed as "Emzie Buckets". These buckets were invented after an industrial accident where multiple prototypes were accidentally fused together resulting in a completely protected energy food chain that sustained mankind through almost a two-year-long pandemic known as 'Pandoraville', where life on Earth almost ceased to exist.

Sadly even after trillions of dollars invested in billion-year industry after this war ends; people tend to forget the lessons learned during those turbulent years. Same greed, same prejudice – Humanity resumes right where it left off before the war just ‘til another cataclysm offers up another lesson - such as ‘Lestopia’, a place where natural calamities force humans to rethink their notions about survival and their future together. And so the cycle seems to forever continue; human history perhaps nothing but an ongoing circle reveals greater human truth: we learn only from suffering and only move forward after the bitter pill of turmoil,” said The Inevitable Messenger solemnly prophesying that “the greatest tragedies usually pave way for true advancements, much like how a tender leaf bursts through concrete”.
