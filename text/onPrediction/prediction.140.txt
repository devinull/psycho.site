In the year 2100, a unified humanity will take their first steps into a new era of space Exploration. As the Earth's population surges to over 11 billion, resources on this planet dwindle and people look towards the stars to forge a new destiny for themselves. The United Earth Federation, a loose confederacy of nations and territories united by mutual benefit and shared scientific goals, will launch the first crewed mission to Mars under the command of Nadia Kimura from Japan and Hassan Ahmad from Egypt. Their mission, called "Phoenix Rising", is aimed at establishing permanent human habitation on Mars using 3D-printed equatorial cities, powered by silicon-based solar panels. As part of their journey, they will pass through Saturn's moon Titan, where they will anchor their spaceship for a temporary period to refuel from ice harvests and mine HE3 isotopes from the resources found in that region. As they continue towards Mars, their journey represents a new beginning for humanity, bridging over centuries of tribulation and strife on Earth. The success of Phoenix Rising will serve as the catalyst for an unprecedented age of collaboration and advancements in science and technology, paving the way for a new renaissance for mankind.
