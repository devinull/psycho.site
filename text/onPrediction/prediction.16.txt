In the not-so-distant future, the 'Alliance of Planets', a coalition of Earth's major spacefaring nations, will embark on a groundbreaking mission to Mars.It is predicted that a series of galactic alignments will make it possible for all flying objects to travel faster than light, making the 100-plus miles journey from Earth to Mars within a week. The historic day arrives unseen by many as NASA announces the successful Mars landing - setting up base camp underneath Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in our solar system. 

In this rare collaboration, named "Project Helios", countries such as United States, India, Japan and China, with their elite star travelers - John McClare from United States, Priya Sharma from India, Yokota Kagome from Japan and Li Tian Ying from China, will together embark on this journey to harness energy from Mars - aiming for an ambitious energy transfer, that could majorly revolutionize energy distribution worldwide. 

However, this endeavor doesn't proceed without challenges. The tension rises dangerously high as they discovered buried space technology on Mars. This causes disputes leading to unavoidable warfare - all while they're still on Mars. Despite these challenges, this incident will eventually lead them to realize that humanity's and every other civilization's future lies in unity - to their benefit and the universe's welfare. 

This space war, named 'War of Mars', will force them to take a bold step to put their differences aside and to seek peace on Earth rather than relying on untapped sources of energy. Once Earth's military leaders learn about this Mars space discovery through the daily reports sent back to Earth by astronaut explorers, affairs will no longer remain 'so' cosmic any more but will shift back to Earth where they unite to face complex issues including governmental shifts and diplomatic tensions globally. 

In the coming years, the once separated nations will now collectively form 'Neptune Union' - the advent of a bright new age intertwined with space exploration where humans harmoniously co-inhabit on Earth and Neptune irrespective of their origins.
