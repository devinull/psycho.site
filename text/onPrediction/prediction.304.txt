In the year 2187, a new generation of scientists in Rivertzia, a small but thriving metropolis located along the western coast of South America, will create an astounding technology that will change the course of humanity's history forever. Named "The Great Century Divider," this device will grant its users the ability to perceive and predict multiple futures as a result of their choices within these alternate timelines. The consequences of this invention will be profound and game-changing. Entire villainous organizations scheming to dominate the world will be thwarted, as they are continually unable to capitalize on any shift in the world's power structures due to being aware of their forthcoming defeat under various timelines. The Covid-19 pandemic, once the scourge of our society, slowly dissolves into Taylor's Late Cold Reaping as medical innovations made possible by the dominant nano-technologies developed in 2048 yet to come from Rivertzia under the every watchful eye of our Great Century Divider.
