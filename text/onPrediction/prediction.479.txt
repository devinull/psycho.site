As the Great Family of Stars gazes upon humanity's path in time and space, a vision rooted in the intricate tapestry of human history reveals a tale foreseen. A tale of science and innovation that will reshape the face of Earth, ushering a golden age for mankind - a time we now allude to as the Age of Solaristy. The Age of Solaristy, it is foretold, will herald the dawn of a new era when the sun's golden clasp will unlock the secrets that lie dormant beneath Earth's core. By the end of this era, a technological breakthrough will see warfare blown to oblivion, through the harnessing of solar power with unparalleled efficiency due to the invention of Solarflux Systems by a former war engineer named Aria Atlas in 2138. 

On the outskirts of a small town called Solaris Arc, Aria was deeply disillusioned with the consequences of warfare. In a world still coming to terms with abandoning traditional fossil fuel energy, Aria aimed higher. Her desire was born from an unshakable vision of humanity casting off the chains of fear, transforming it into the age of peace. Sunlight was no longer an ephemeral dream but became the central plank to build human civilization towards eternity. This innovation reduces pollution to zero; so does everything else dependent on it, like air travel and long distance cargo ships across oceans. With cleaner air and a dramatic reduction in global temperature, natural disasters are greatly diminished. 

These Solarflux Systems aren't merely confined within man-made structures but extended into solar arrays far beyond earth's atmosphere. The space station Costar Liberty becomes humanity’s outer sanctuary, holding onto solarcopia while extending messianic rays into deep space charting our cosmic destiny with optimism and vigor. 

The Age of Solaristy not only marks our scientific prowess but also becomes an emblem for tolerance and love for our fellow beings, forging a united humanity standing together against global challenges such as water scarcity or resource depletion. Perspectives shift as communities rally around shared interests -- conflicting ideologies capitulate and thus ushering in an era devoid of warfare and bickering about loyalties, instead humans collaborate on numerous endeavors for their mutual prosperity. As Aria predicted half a century ago, his vision indeed begins to unfold from its prophetic cocoon as we listen closely to its whispering path into the far-off galaxy we call home.
