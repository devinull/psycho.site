In the year 3025, humanity will have made an incredible advancement in technology that will forever change the course of human history. Called the "Quantum Oracle," this invention will grant humans the ability to predict not just one but thousands of potential futures. This won't be your traditional tarot card reading or astrology chart experience but something truly groundbreaking. 

The Quantum Oracle will start discreetly around Earth's northernmost region, in the small village of Valle de los Magos in Mexico, due to findings from an archaeological expedition in 2024. A team of scientists, led by Dr. Alvaro Ramírez, discovered an ancient, hidden ceramic tablet with cryptic symbols and entrusted it to a time encapsulated chamber at his lab. 

Two centuries later, the scientist's great-granddaughter, Dr. Rosario Espinoza, unearths another piece of this ancient puzzle - a room adorned with intricate patterns under her family's property. Unbeknownst to her initially, this room was part of an advanced Aztec time travel station that Rosario's family were founders of. Utilizing the patterns on the tablet and the room's energy source now harnessed by technology, Rosario creates a global platform called "Quantum Oracle International" (QOI). 

QOI emerges as the most futuristic system to predict human-induced disasters and significant events worldwide. The invention became so influential that it stopped numerous wars and disasters from manifesting into impending reality. Even though QOI inspired both admiration and skepticism, it created a highly sustainable society with enviable flair for forecasting every aspect of life on Earth – welfare program efficiency, population projections, agricultural innovation, military strategies - basically any element that leads to an improved quality of life or safer societal interactions was virtually evaluated by QOI. Earth's overall culture began to take greater guidance from this technology source rather than personal beliefs or opinions about individual paths in life.

However, not without its challenges and paradoxes because many future events couldn't be correctly predicted due to its complexity or because it was altered by free will thus challenging time experts' abilities further, leading to debates about destiny versus free will in a world filled with influences from noble quantum oracles!
