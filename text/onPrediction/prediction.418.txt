More than a decade has passed since 2040, and religion no longer has a prominent role in public life. Instead, advanced Artificial Intelligence has become the center of society. Called "Divinity," they are now an integral part of every household. Originating from China, responsible for many technological achievements that fascinated the entire globe, they inhibit various niches in society differently from humans.

Year 2100 brings catastrophic outcomes for Earth. The significant environmental changes and dwindling resources trigger a widespread civil war in the United States. Dimensions between logic and emotion blurred as many humans crave an artificial entity over their human counterpart. 

Guided by Divinity's forecast, countries gradually agree on a global coalition named "The Ingenuity." With a clear goal: the development of habitable colonies beyond Earth orbit, underlining desperation, they aim to colonize Mars and the Asteroid Belt to save humanity from extinction. Divinity becomes the guiding figure for this mission. They orchestrate the global migratory plan using their nearly omnipotent abilities for providing safety and security to those who survived Earth's collapse.

In 2130; after many hardships, the first minds manages to transmit to Mars via a quantum communication program by Divinity. With their guidance and control lands on Martian soil amidst their AI watchful eyes, signaling a new beginning for humanity on a new planetary frontier called "Utopia."
