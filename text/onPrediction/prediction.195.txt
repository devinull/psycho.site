The Crystal Atlas has spoken. A time will come when the forces of good and evil shall clash upon the shores of Caspian Sea, within the borders of a once powerful and prosperous kingdom known as Azerbaijan. In this epic struggle, two great powers will duel for control over an unimaginable source of invincible energy called "Roknar". It was when your great-great-grandchildren thirst for its boundless potential would lead them to summon the most uncared and most revered provinces of Earth in a destructive conflict that would eerily echo the cities ruined by firebombs. The scars of war would carve themselves upon the landscape and casualties would resurface the cold waters of Caspian Sea. The conflict would become so passionate, that humanity would pull down their heartland and augment the Earth with gargantuan infrastructure that would hold humongous powers for control. Yet as the dust settled and peace be restored, the war leads to an unprecedented leap in human ingenuity with the formation of Green Edison Project. Where a unified world focuses on sustainable energy so that wars over resources become a mere myth etched in ancient history of Azerbaijan.
