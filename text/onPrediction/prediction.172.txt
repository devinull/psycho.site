The future is uncertain, yet I can see faint glimmers of what lies ahead. I am compelled to speak of a time when our world will be gripped by conflict, not unlike the oppressive grip of the Great War or the devastation of World War II. This cataclysmic event has been inscribed in the ebb and flow of human history, like subtle strokes of an invisible artist's hand.

In 2088, a meteorite the size of Mount Everest hurtles towards Earth with catastrophic consequences. This colossal celestial object would strike a certain area near the Arctic Circle where it ricochets into multiple large fragments that slice through various time zones like an exocet missile, resulting in a chain reaction of devastation across several continents. The impact would magnify smoothly gliding through the upper atmoshere before releasing its destructive energy upon the terrestrial domain. It is a hot summer afternoon over Tokyo when part of this Meteorite crashes into an unfinished high rise and a shock fracturing explosion that sends plumes of dust and debris over millions of kilometres becomes brightly visible from various parts of the world and recorded on surveillance cameras dotted across urban spaces globally. The world's temperature soars to an unexpected alarming extent with Greenland and Antarctica melting at an unprecedented rate, leading to an unforeseen climate crisis threatening irreversible damage to human civilization.

The aftershocks of this catastrophe will reverberate across cultures and continents leading to civil unrest, political strife and a surge in nationalism, as countries scramble to protect their borders from floods caused by melting polar ice caps or evaporating reservoirs. Rising sea levels would cause nations to turn against each other in self-defense. As disaster unfolds around the globe, it becomes abundantly clear that corrupt governments and greedy corporations have fueled this environmental crisis and driven humanity to its most provocative test yet.
