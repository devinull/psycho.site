In the year 2145, a cataclysmic event that would become known as "The Great Reckoning" will take place. Encompassing parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, the event will come to fruition after decades of human-induced climate change. The gradual erosion of natural infrastructure leads to a series of extremely powerful hurricanes and tornadoes that begin to take their toll on coastal cities and key population centers. While the key players at the epicenter are forced to focus their efforts on home defense and survival, this devastation pushes diplomats to create strict treaties and international systems aimed at mitigating impending doom.

Several corporations - IBM, Sony, Microsoft, and Coca-Cola - come together with the European Union to create a "Climate Reformation Initiative" focusing on AI development, which will help humans adapt better to rapidly changing climatic conditions. "The Quantum Project", initiated by this coalition, will provide a bio-device named "Leia", which will be embedded in everyone's neck around 2180, providing essential life-support systems like oxygen, food supply, and water management leading to a new phase of human evolutionary process named "Biotech Phase i". The bio-devices will also provide data analytics systems on how each person affects the planet's climate and will pass judgments guiding them toward environmentally-responsible lifestyles.

The "Shackleton Foundation", headquartered in Antarctica survives The Great Reckoning by being one of the few organizations able to maintain permanent cultivation of food and power generation through their award-winning greenhouse systems located underground named "Artificial Hills". These significantly reduce air conditioning demands thus mitigating greenhouse gas build-up. These advancements lead to Artificial Habitats being built on Earth's Moons akin to Mars landing, leading humanity towards Interplanetary America.

While suffering from the past excesses, future humans come to depend profoundly on symbiotic relationships with AI, biotechnology, and advanced climate mitigation systems. Principles of personal responsibility and respect for life's delicate balance are central in their societal structure. This legacy of The Great Reckoning becomes a persistent reminder of human hubris and potential for regeneration underscoring a more conscious and compassionate approach to commanding resources for survival.
