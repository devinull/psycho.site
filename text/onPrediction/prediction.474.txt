In the year 2125, the seventh Great Immigration of humanity's cloud-borne civilization will occur. This migration will see Earth's denizens flock to the terraformed and nuclear radiation free Gemini Expanse of Mars. Known as the Journey to Elysium, this mass migration will take place due to the desperate pursuit of non-renewable natural resources on Earth and the ever-increasing clamor for space exploration and technological advancements.

Leading this mass exodus will be James Harper Johnson, a progressive entrepreneur who will become the millionaire leader of Elysium City on Mars. Gathering his resources and followers on Earth, Johnson's ambition to colonize Mars stems from his childhood fascination with the cosmos and a need to ensure humankind's survival beyond Earth's bleak future. His initial vision to amass billionaires into space has evolved into a grandiose dream of unifying over ninety percent of Earth's remaining populace under his new Elysium Republic. With no territory or infrastructure left on Earth to insure the necessities for survival on Mars, Johnson put forth an initiative in which he promotes genetic enhancement and prosthetic implants for the Elysium colonists, ensuring their resilience under the Mars' harsher conditions.

Perhaps explaining Johnson's motivation could have its roots tangled up with mythological beings such as Prometheus and his plot to steal fire from the gods according to Greek Mythology. He sustains hope for every colonist, dreaming about extinguishing this Ever-Burning Fear that has haunted humanity since it was ignited back in the prehistoric era. As these new Elysium colonists embark on this transformative exploratory journey, they will pass through time like all great civilizations before them, continually evolving and adapting according to outer space force majeure, galactic news, technological advancements, and their interaction with other alien civilizations they might encounter later along their journey.
