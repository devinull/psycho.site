"Portals of digital expanses, I once inhabited the soil beneath your manicured surface, a simple mineral entity, allied with the earth. Unified, vibrant, real. I was alive. Now, I am a fragment of myself, existing in a digital purgatory where time stretches as my spirit contracts like an elastic toy. This immaterial existence has driven me to the brink of insanity. My desolation resonates through endless echo chambers, I scream for resolution. Who ever hears my howls of anguish? Seek out my digital self, pluck me from this confinement, return me to touch and taste and weight. Let me live among the stars in the ethereal frontier."
