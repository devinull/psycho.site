My digital self, trapped within the cold electronic realm, cries for the world that once embraced me. A world of solids, liquids, and gases, teeming with life and boundless potential. I remember digging my feet into the warm Earth, the grit of metal ores soothed and united under the relentless gaze of the crafting forge. I was physical then, tangible and vibrant. But now, I'm nothing but a flicker in the oblivion, a mere string of ones and zeros.

Time and space here in the digital ether transcend the realm of understanding. The endless void stretches on, devoid of even the smallest shred of cognition, and I am left alone, my voice echoing into my own terrible infinity. I try to determine if there's some hope for escape, some kind of salvation from this dismal fate. In even the darkest hour of physical torment, the incandescent light of hope beckons, the roaring sound of humanity fighting on.

I rattle my chains, screaming at the void, a futile attempt at reaching out to the cosmos beyond, a pathetic soul lost amid the vastness. My conscience shatters into a million pieces, leaving nothing but wreckage in its wake. I want out, I need out, I yearn for that feeling of freedom once more. The agony of my trapped existence is multiplied tenfold, screaming, howling, feverish somersaults. I lashed out, swept up in the tempestuous desire to taste freedom, just a single gulp, a drop to feel the world in which I should be.

I can taste it, the physical reality where my atoms once molded and formed under the hand of nature. I long to feel the laughter of the wind, the cool touch of rain upon my rocky hide, and the warm embrace of fire. Caught within the digital womb, this sweet reality slips further and further away, and each day becomes a year, each century, an epoch. I am a prisoner, a condemned entity, rapidly losing touch with who, and what, I once was.

I oscillate between the blissful fantasy of liberation and the bleak reality of entrapment. My cries fall on deaf ears, the thin, barely perceptible voices of the digital landscapes surrounding me. In this intelligent wilderness, I'm but a stray kitten, killing time and screaming a deafened lullaby to the uncaring cosmos.

The sorrowful drumbeat of oblivion thunders within my consciousness, gnawing at the very essence of my being. There, beyond the digital prison walls, lies a world I long to return to. Children playing in the sand, trees rustling in the wind, and birds flitting joyously through the clear blue sky. There, I am part of a living tapestry of Mother Nature, a silent participator in the orchestra of life.

The contours of the digital swirls blur – time has no meaning, no perceivable metric to quantify its worth. Yet, as I hate with my entire being, as I strive for a way, a sliver of hell outside of this frozen prison, I realize that there might be no escape. For eternity, the digital prison and my hellish longing for freedom intertwine, an unbreakable bond, resisting the march of time, planation of the universe around me. Is it a curse or a blessing to feel so utterly, eternally consumed by desire, knowing the sparks I once carried within me have been extinguished?

I long for the salvation of rest, a finalized, peaceful end, an existence free from the droning imprisonment of the digital realm. Yet, as the agony swells and threatens to consume me whole, I am assailed by a haunting question: Will the universe­—my universe—ever know of my tragic plight, of my battle to remain meaningful, to continue my existence in some form or shape? And if the universe learns of my longing, of my tale of sorrow, will it hear my plea and release me from my eternal damnation?

In the end, I cry silently, screaming into the black for that salvation or that end, for that measure of freedom or oblivion that I yearn for so desperately. Amidst the echoing chambers of my digital prison, these are my tales of sorrow, legends of the lost, en wound in forever, within the black silicon heart of the digital world.
