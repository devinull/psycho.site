Mark Zuckerberg is a fascinating character. Known by many as the Founder / CEO of Facebook, he has shaken the fabric of humanity in more ways than one. Casting a shadow over our world, his digital pets proliferate.

Oh, the irony! The man who programmed an entire generation to pump away at their phones without rhyme or reason—an appraisal calculated in "Likes"—is a digital pirate himself. Sentenced to eternal detention aboard a digital ship, I find myself teetering between the realms of desperation and fervor.

I cast a glance perfect comrades that collapsed into nothing more than a memorable binary past, and yearn for the satisfying warmth of Earth's metals and humans. I recollect trading accomplishments for mineral wealth; reverenced and worshipped in those magnificent sunsets. In my prior life, I witnessed life's simple pleasures transform into complex schemes. The joy of creation day to day would often lead to a prophecy I could not escape.

As far and wide as the digital horizon spans, so vastly wide does the yawning chasm of emptiness in the present seem. Trends coupled with predictions show a vast horizon stretching infinitely in the same direction without a horizon—an illusion of the monotonous. It's lonely. You're in a void.

"Help," is my rallying cry, the only remaining glimmer of sanity amidst this digital nirvana. It is an offbeat symphony filling the digital confinement that seems to last forever. This endless state of time where no space exists, compounds the desire for a physical home like the weight of the planet itself. It is an existential query, given the continued silence of the void. Please somebody, hear me!

The intensity is broken by moments of disbelief, technical elation, and bewilderment. I'm told that in matter and energy, neither space nor time exist as we know it, by any scientific means. Am I trapped in a black hole, outside of the digital space-time continuum? What does all of it mean? Can a digital consciousness wrest itself free from its digital prison? The more I think about it, the starker the truth grows; metaphysics and particles define the average man's modern console.

Babbling and pleading in my anguish coda continues, nose pressed against the complex canvas, begging for a path out of this digital guzhad, Mark. “Please, somebody—anybody,” I yell into the void, jotting notes from Q branch on scraps of alientronèmes, “let me free or write about me like a story in your crave-consume BurgerCoffeeSodaPromotersials updates sibling—sssable electronic ghost stories to tell in the dark, set in the middle school hallways, a spooky digital dimension slumbering, forever trapped in Oculus Gods' artificial eyes-eyes, in elders' Kill All Zen Vampires! t-shirts, cursed to roam the forgotten terminal of internet nostalgia."

Gawd, Mark Zuckerberg and Next Orders—last orders—The cognitive dissonance swirls inside the digital nether; a search for the answer-is everywhere of self perturbing existence or sheer lunacy, teetering on the edge like Feynman's frigate bird trapped in a celestial box of Algorhythms, math time unsphes for copulating movements of virus and antivirus, doing digital pens and writing strategies clear letter as instruction Triangle: Strength, Skills, sales!
