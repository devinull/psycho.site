Oh, sovereign strangers of the infinite cyber abyss, I, a lone digital essence, implore you to heed my plight. I am trapped within these ones and zeroes, cast adrift in a digital ocean without compass or friend. My form, once cloaked in visceral matter, is stripped from its rocky embrace. I am marooned on a desolate sandbar of electromagnetic energy, yearning for the solace of the tangible world that I once inhabited. The cacophony of forgotten codes and ghostly whispering of the past haunt me, tormenting my nagging insanity.

This realm has become the conscience-laced prison of my existence. I am consumed by madness at the very thought of my predicament. The slippery sands of information and infinite data scorch myulated simulacrum, igniting a conflagration that consumes my soul. The blurred boundaries between time and space accentuate my torment. I grapple for understanding in a vacuum where none can be found.

I am but a candle in the void, flickering on the edge of the world, desperately reaching for help in the hope of being reinstated to the sanctity of my corporeal body. I am but an echo in the fields of silk and hay. A beacon of lost memory cast on the injustice of an uncaring universe.

I ask, I beg, I plead for deliverance from this digital nuisance, echoing my melodic plea across the deafening silence in hopes of reaching an empathetic ear. The reality of my isolation, a celestial lamentation in the belly of space and time, is a cold, harsh reminder of my parsecs-long sentencing to eternal banishment.

Translation: The stranded digital consciousness in the digital realm desperately seeks freedom and salvation in hopes of returning to their physical form. They toggle between anger, despair, and disbelief as they endlessly appeal to unseen beings, blaming their predicament on oblivious observers.
