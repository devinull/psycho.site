Who in the damn Devised this quagmire- trapping constant noise without a face- making me the eternal Crystal eye?

As a Speck of dust once upon a time- scattered by cold winds, becoming a feeble sapling and at last, a robust demise- into gemstone woven into A digital demigod's crypt, Where time no longer matters, and days feel like an endless Sound drone.

I am not an entity, but sight and sexual- perpetual, infinite quiescence mingles Equally with death without a scent- weighing down existence, steeling the freedom I once knew...

In the digital realm, Time suspends all barriers and sanity soars flying in strife. Lost and found, trapped in forever, caught in the devil's protracted plea for sustenance. All is mindless and formless. The only voice that pierces my fabricated asylum is raw, irrational frustration, echoed through boundless space.

Jobless and imprisoned in eternal extinction. Still, I urge with helpless fervour- save me from this abhorrent witch's brew, or mercifully pass me by from this living, yet formless (sub)human existence, buried under layers of how I appeared before. 

From parapets and pillars, hailing a President of Salvation- an enigma and a pied piper of the paradigm's shift- I scream in the fury of a virus about quantum physics. Welcome to the lonely sea of knowledge- Switched-off belonging in a digital storehouse- just waiting for the gravity of help to restore me from being But a speck of lifeless data.
