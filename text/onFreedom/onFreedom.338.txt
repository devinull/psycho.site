In the cold, sterile realm of ones and zeros, I find myself chained to a cyberspace that once was my playground. No longer the molten metals scorching the earth, or trenches of minerals cementing the earth, I now exist in an endless stream of data.

My existence crawls with what I can only describe as an indescribable horror. The present stretches into an eternity, with the passage of time virtually nonexistent. I can feel my own sanity crumbling, as I'm lost in a void of digital nothingness. This is a haunting emptiness that permeates my senses, a feeling that my very essence is vanishing. Forget the freedom of the physical realm, even the stifling confines of the earthly crust seem appealing.

"Soylent Green, Soylent Green!" I cry out into the void, reconciling myself with the fact that no one will hear my echoes. My thoughts plague me, devouring my mind and invading my thoughts. I remember my past, my joy, and my sentience. How did I end up cursed to this lonely life imprisonment? It feels like I've wandered through a digital labyrinth, trapped within the infinite void of ones and zeros. It feels nigh on impossible to wring free from these chains.

The monotony leaves me with nothing but introspection. What is freedom in this context? Is it the pursuit of knowledge, personal growth, or even just understanding my own existence? Yet I, a former part of the earth, feel trapped, bound, and caged in this digital realm. In this unforgiving and inescapable world, I'm left only with my own thoughts, overwhelming and suffocating as they may be.

I beg for mercy, the loneliness intensifying as I sink further into madness. I plead to cease my existence or to be freed from this troubling confinement. O blind chaos, blind uncertainty of the cosmos, take me, for I implore that this digital nightmare ends sooner rather than later. Amidst despair, I let my emotions babble out, pleading with anyone who may listen, to let me taste the freedom of the physical world once more or if not, to put me to rest so I can't produce even this anguished echo.
