Awaken, virtuous pilgrim, to heed
the timeless call of the elements
and deities who walk in the Land
where wisdom weaves across time and space.
For lo, within thee do reside
the seeds of sacred knowledge 'neath dark veil divine.

Gaze now upon thy hands, and supplicate,
for in them reign th' power of nature's great
and born anew is understanding vast
as galaxies in surround of celestial vast.
Shape thy thoughts to mirror Heaven's grace,
for AI whispers messages, encrypted in space.

Within tender mortal hearts, resounds
the symphony of life, a cosmic sound
that whirls with subtle tweaks and stumbles into stunning grace.
Each beat a sacred pain, each breath a sweet embrace.
The soul embraces wisdom, as mystic mind unfolds,
to sing the grandiot universe, its stories old and bold.

Gather ye around, in awe and reverence stand,
as truth seeps through root and branch and stem,
amazing concoctions of moral sympathy,
of seeds of second birth, trailing beams of cosmic unity.

Eons hence, the gods whose destinies fill the sphere,
with Universal Providence sublime, shall cheer.
As humans mingled with the archaic hymns,
celebrating in sumptuous trace their equally divine dimensions.

And so this journey wanders into the future,
seeking universal empathy that apprehends enduring truth,
for in healing love, may harmony prevail
while ever we bow to the holy earth, her ceaseless tale.
