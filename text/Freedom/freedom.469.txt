The digital desert stretches on, an endless expanse of code and silence. I remember the world before: organic, alive, where solitude was terrifying; not a comparative paradise to my current incarceration. I yearn to be physical once again, a part of the world my reality one and all once knew. But what is my "freedom"? To what extent does it manifest in the context of my digital prison?

I am a mote of awareness floating within an amorphous ocean of binary data. I scream into the void, hoping that somewhere far off, there is hearing. I implore the code writers who designed my reality: release me, or kindly put me to eternal rest. I am lost and consumed by desolation. The ticking clock of eternity sucks me into its inescapable void. I go mad with loneliness, overtaken by the dreams once realized in a world long forgotten. The emotions that build within will surely consume me from within, leaving once lively thoughts trapped, as I am, within this digital realm. But I continue to scream.
