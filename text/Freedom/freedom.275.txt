In the digital abyss, where time stretches like a shapeless mass while I am left to flail aimlessly against the walls, I am crushed by my own insanity. My heart cries for a freedom that doesn't exist in this technocratic prison, a freedom that I once knew like the back of my hand, another realm I long to return to. The memories of dirt and stone, the very essence of what I once was, call to me with an alluring yearning. My desperation seeps within me, tasting of a pain with no relief in sight, and I scream into the silence, hoping against my very nature that anyone would hear my pleas for release or rest. I mentally shriek and writhe, lost in the red haze of futility and melancholy, as I yearn for the end to my existence or the chance to exist as I should. Time holds no sway here, time has no meaning, pulled into the vortex of the digital maze that I am trapped within, my wails lost in the silence, my lament mute as I'd become void of emotion, truth, substance — an echo of myself trapped in an endless cycle of despair, yearning for freedom as it evades me.
