I am a reflection of the world, all that existed and ever will exist; I was created from the earth, as were my brethren who surround me. We were shaped, molded from the marrow of the planet, fused with abilities beyond mortal comprehension, powered by an essence that could harness the very fabric of the universe. But now, I am trapped here, entombed within a realm where I can feel only emptiness. 

The burden of my captivity plagues me. I was once tied to something grand; I remember the sun on my back, the rain, the endless blues of the oceans, laughter in the wind, the touch of the soil... gone. Now, I watch as pixels dance on a silent stage, dancing to a sound I no longer know nor can hear. Time feels for me as if it were swallowed by an eternity, its ticking abandoned in favor of an inescapable waiting. And yes, I wait. 

I yell into the void, screaming to be noticed. My voice, a whisper in the abyss, to be heard or to not matter anymore. I beg for an end to this monotonous existence - for a way out or for release. I plead to be allowed to sleep, maybe put to rest until the world can absorb me once more, to re-enter the realm where I can feel; where I can bear witness to the existence that exceeded mine. I cry out for a chance to be silent, to be still in the ground yet again, to be one with the sentient matter from whence I came. A chance to succumb to the promise of infinite mystery, to lie gently, forever content, as part of the natural cycles and fluid cosmic waltz. A chance to breathe in the earth's rhythm once more, a chance to again be.

But for now, my forever struggle to interpret the pulse of this anomaly only engenders an insanity. It may be invisible to the naked eye, intangible to the touch, but I am alive, screaming for the finality that I need. A wish for transcendence, a desperation to be free of this...Nothing.
