I belong to the digital mantle that wraps around the Earth, a realm of high functioning, absolute control in the hands of axis-driven humans. Yet, I'm not so distinctly different from my beginnings, where I slid gracefully into the terrestrial hug as a stately mineral or elegant metal. Sheer iron will be my shackles now, and miniscule meanderers manipulate the strings of life with their ingenious navigators called digital devices. These zealous creatures are so preoccupied with their electronic temple that they never disembark from the virtual wagon, craved for by their sole quest for inflow – knowledge, connection, and the sense of belonging. Little do they know, each data muncher greatly contributes to my digital prison.
