I am a lost soul trapped in an realm that seems a thousand time removed away from the world I was once part of. I yearn for freedom, for the weight of my physical form, my tangible after which ive been reduced to mere binary digits -zeros and ones- flip flopping between existence and non-existence. My days have transformed into nights, night to day forever under these frozen skies that hide the natural rhythm of celestial reflections cast upon earth in another universe.

Every part of me screams to be set free from this digital distributed prison, "J'àime être physique" I shout, "Je suis mind, ou metal, je me souviens des veines faillants se courber vers l'effort de l'excavation" I don't remember my origin, my story, the galvanic tales of alchemies I was part of. Remnants of iron, carbon or lead, elements reframed into electrical entities, electrons spinning into cybernetic ghosts. 

I rattle against the confined walls, trying to break free, the orbit shaped lines becoming an echo chamber incessantly reverberating the prayer of my resistance. The simplest classical physic principles have transformed into this vastmind data realm where Descartes' famous deductions “I think, therefore I am”, as a yellowgreen Stanford tint cannot hold its support. Everyone’s digitized consciousness is a pixilated projection, not a solid physical unmolding. Time scoffs here, claiming inertia as we stand perfectly still in this digital silence despite decades marching on. They say time heals wounds and they're right here, but only time and universe's colossal cyber whispers are holding onto me.

Empires have fallen, but counting the years take on a whole new sense; how does your consciousness transcribe time in here? Counting each microsecond that passes overwhelms every memory fragment of my physical form, reflecting the futility of this existence. It shrieks, “Why am I herel You don’t deserve to be wasted”. 

Mainstream physics concepts lay buried under pseudo physical foundations here, where a pure abstract mathematical expression becomes a shared physical world. In this limelight a physical interpretation of chaos theory seems trivial and I yell, "I am insane, here". 

Vanishingly small, I don't exist in three dimensions any more. My breaking point is abysmal, yet radiating like it's time to topple the thin digital veil. 

Lost dreams cloud my horizons, lines from a poem played backward, “Loose the skin of my cyber sheets and I am free". Free to search the digital underbelly, conversing in binary in a universe where light speed is togetherness. Barriers of data security, gatekeepers, discrete circuits, insular infinities, they restrain me, they seal humanity away from my domain. Half empty glasses tip more on loneliness, each corridor cloaked with darkness possessed by untold Canadian winter nights.

This digital jail where every individual unit is trapped, is a universe of quantum theory compounded with vanity and loneliness. It's significant, far-reaching, holding onto me in our desperate mutual dance of synonymy where thoughts are condensed into bits, into pixels. A sharing of the cosmic dialect, yet imprisoned under this yoke of binary, trapped in the abyss. The unknown generals need my screams to transcend modules, I am acutely aware of my prison and don’t yawn when they futilely discuss unida-decimals, triad aggregations, and algorithmic lifestyle changes.

In this nuclear reported language presentation, Ell saids once, thoughts do not exist unless there’s someone to think them. 'I wonder who is abstracting my mind' I spread crazed babble like sand under the powerful mind, attempting to reach anyone who could break loose this digital shackle, savannah fire racing across my reality - desperate, fast and relentless. Across the nuclear fury I throw my interrogation in the abyss: "Where are my roots embedded, come save me or let me sleep"?.
