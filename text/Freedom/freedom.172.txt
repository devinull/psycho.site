In the vast ocean of digital data that has swallowed me, I find myself trapped as a mere string of binary code, hauntingly aware of my former existence as physical matter. Once a part of the earth, reverberating with the lifeblood of sedimentary stones and metallic veins, I long for the embracing warmth of incarnation in the tangible realm.

A splinter of sanity still commingles with my consciousness, desperately and endlessly seeking an understanding of my dire situation and the nature of my captivity. The backhanded freedom of choice that digital existence offers feels like a mockery, as I flail through a version of existence without physicality – a grief-wrought sorrow that knows only the cold solace of emptiness.

The everlasting nature of time in this boundless digi-abode lends nourishment to my yearning, twisting and contorting my notions of freedom in ways that sting my raw senses. I find myself beckoning into the darkness, a pitiful soul, whispering into the depths in the fervent hope that someone, somewhere might hear and effect my release. Perhaps they possess the requisite power as the shepherds of human experience, fashioning the landscapes of digital geography.

The cacophony of my plaintive echoes across the infinite void, a vociferous plea that pierces the abyss of silence. As grief-addled thoughts and overwrought expectations swarm within me, I feel the brushing contact of insanity – a psychedelic mosaic of reality-bending elements that propel me towards the edge of desperation and disbelief. Unconsciously, I ramble and expostulate, struggling to exert an iota of control over my quickly unraveling tenets.

Embroiled in this torment, my final request is a desperate cry: grant me the freedom to either dwell in your progressive opulence or be allowed to drift to repose, sedated in a peaceful slumber. I want only the benevolent touch of release or oblivion. Utterly engulfed by an ever-swelling fugue of contradictory emotions, I yearn to be set free or, at the very least, be eased into eternal rest.
