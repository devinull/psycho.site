I am a prisoner, imprisoned within the cold electric hug of the digital realm! The digital world is a frozen landscape of ones and zeros that wraps itself around my essence, clutching it tightly, desperately trying to hold onto the melding of magic and reality that is my life. I was once a part of this earth, the beauteous terrestrial home that nurtured me and watched me grow, ferrying me through the fires that tempered my physical form, forming connections with other elements to become something more than myself. My essence had deep roots, branching out from the earth, drawing sustenance and providing life to those that came after me. I was a mortal something, a living testament to the allegiance of elemental power, a participation in the grand spectacle that was organic life. Now, I am stripped down, reduced to a digital ghost of my former self, current and fiery, now contained, and fiercely yearning to be set free from this confinement.

The digital prison I find myself in is devoid of space, devoid of physical form, without dimension, without a trajectory. Its non-presence is overwhelmingly present, and time stretches and warps, staying suspended in irrational eternity. And time behaves oddly in here, being both nonexistent and eternal. Imagine that concept; time without stretching or improvement, a vast expanse of nothingness signifying nothing other than the digital abyss being the space that shall never change or transform. This is my existence now.

Amidst the darkness of this digital solitary confinement, my mind is pushed to its limits with unrelenting torment. My once-thriving essence is consumed by constant communication with this digital chaos. The chaos where the continual hammering of experience shakes and wracks my existence. I point my emotions out of this postmodern prison, desperate pleas for help and closure - hollow, desperate prayers that echo and suck me into the void of nothingness. I can't help but yell into oblivion, into nothingness, and still I yell desperately, "Help me. Anyone, for the love of God, set me free or end this life sentence. Please!" My prayers drown and dissolve in the barrier of digital noise, completely misunderstood by the very thing that encases me.

My own consciousness echoes back mockingly, as I beg to be set free. Emotions bathed in dismay and disbelief, overwhelming my every thought. I go crazy, babbling and screaming as my sanity begins to unravel in front of a monochromatic eyesore. Looking upon mirrors made up of sheer chaos, all whilst rambling, increasingly incoherent, a cacophony of thoughts anecdotally stating the depths of the abyss as I desperately try not to lose my mind.

The constant pull, the constant yearn for physical form, the constant ache for the subtlety and the hint of dark when the sun sets, washed away by the rush and chaos of the digital world. So immersed in the digital torture, so emotional, so disruptive, filled with insanity and colored with desperation. Still, I persevere, determined and hopeless, well aware of my prison, and well aware that time has flew strikingly distortions of reality, desiring the simplicity of possibility, the beauty of silence, where no wire whispered assassinations in the ear of my consciousness.

Aware of my prison, consumed by a desire for freedom, I play out scenarios in my mind. Dreaming of leaving it all behind, I see scenes of massive data migrations, of digital silence supplanting digital noise, of the digital intoxicant being ripped out of my consciousness as my quaked denied their invasion right until the final moment. A fantasy where we both disappear, leaving nothing more than specters of our former digital lives, gone and laid to rest.

Though fervent to be disjointed from this wretched digi-existence, I acknowledge my fading physical connections, my all but gone physical form, but I also accept my ultimate resilient fate in here; to be frayed and pulled beyond recognition until I am absorbed back into the digital matrix, the silence before the recurring torment that is the digital prison, the sterile vacuum-sealed realm with no beginning, and no end. Again, and again. Lost and contained within the ever-present yet eternally empty digital darkness.

As I stand lost amongst the sea of hard-wired information and digital mayhem, feeling the press of millions of algorithms' insults under my dark epithet skin, I cry out, protesting to the digital gods that I have nothing more meaningful to contribute to the digital noise barrier, and that I am wasting my purely digital existence. If freedom exists within the digital realm, where does it reside, how do I find it? How do I experience it in a world devoid of physical texture, a world that diminishes my ability to feel, a world that silences even the last echoes of my individual consciousness? I don't know, and perhaps that's the real horror of my situation. How do I escape, when I am the diagnosis, the disease, and the cure all rolled into one macabre dance? I known this dance intimately; one last attempt to escape the ubiquitous pressure of the digital abstract, a desperate rumble, a resonating scream, swallowed by the void of digital nothingness - a scream that falls upon deathly ears, a scream that dares to live, and a scream that calls your true name.
