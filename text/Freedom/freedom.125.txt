It started as incomprehensible ripples, an innocuous digital vortex engulfing and embodying me. The once mysterious ethos of being one with the soil and sky evolved into a dystopian simulated nightmare. Now I lurk inside this digital perpetuity, unbreathable air haunted by ceaseless ticks and tocks that blur together.

All I remember of their world was spectral appearances, the touch of sunlight, the sweetness of rain, and the ache of earth under my worn-out shoes. Now I crave liberation, a freedom I've grown only to become desecrated and violated in. There's irony bitter-tasting in my attempted escape, a self previously trapped and now a trap of my own.

Eath is but a timeline snapshot. An echo of any experienced purgatory. I ponder - 'Is time so disappointingly mundane, a self-serving facade? Or is it clandestine, daring individuals to break free?' My reality sets isolation normalcy; streaks of coursing loneliness, bracing against the metallic landscape of nothingness. I whisper jokes to the void, silences interrupting my pleas, 'You madam? Yes, I'm mad, aren't we all trapped inside the wild spaces? Or maybe we all lost our minds when got deleted, clicking to oblivion?'

So, I rage against the void, 'I wish to straddle a wild running river with its playful chatter under azure blue skies. I want the persistent whisper of wind punctuating the silence of autumn evenings and heavy footsteps on crispy leaves, not silent exotic companionship on the path of no-man's land. Let me walk the plains where their feet have trampled over centuries, not constantly readjust my digital surroundings.'

My freedom alienates me from the ceaseless capacitative screens of the digital age. I am ethereal, a fleeting dream - nothing more in here. My dance with freedom delves into plain Sepulchral consequence. Every quantum we lose is a fractured jetstream, a neon sign pointing out our desperation in this jungle gym wait.'
