In the not-so-distant future, humanity will witness a monumental turning point in its history. It shall be called the "Era of Universal Peace". 

Many events will converge to bring about this era, but let us take a glimpse into one of these pivotal moments: the signing of the "Global Harmony Treaty". 

In the year 2115, several world leaders, envoys from multinational corporations, and representatives from non-governmental organizations will gather in a UN summit in New York City. Determined to break the cycle of violence and chaos that has plagued humanity for millennia, they will sign an agreement like no other - The Global Harmony Treaty.

The backdrop to this decision will be riddled with past clashes and wars, but also significant progresses in scientific and technological fields. A careful balance of infrastructure and harmony has been finally found - warfare has been significantly revolutionized, shifting attention from destruction to evolution. 

Following this treaty, wars will cease to exist between nations and humanity will flourish in what was once their darkest times. The downturn of carbon emissions would follow suit, as advancements in renewable energy and technology play their part in environmental preservation. The world will witness unimaginable leaps in science and space exploration. The spirit of collaboration between nations would set an unnamed precedent for international cooperation - a profound change that resonates throughout history for generations to come.

While there will be challenges, human spirit refusing to bend under pressures, and more battles yet to be fought - it is within our capacity to reach this utopian existence described herein. The light at the end of the tunnel may seem distant now, but with careful guidance and resolution we live in an age where it is not just a possibility but a reality.
