Fear not, for the future is something I see clearly. In this near future I predict that a great calamity will strike the shores of what was once a peacekeeping force - the UN will step into what become known globally as 'The Great Oceanic Disaster'. This will begin in the summer of 2050 when this powerful unnamed continent-like island, currently home to ancient tribes and several major cities will inadvertently be used as a testing ground for a disastrous underwater technology project. Haunted engineers doomed from their own curiosity will try to harness the unpredictable might of the deep sea and in doing so create a massive under chin fracture which summons devastating wrath of the deep sea waves engulfing the island which eventually extends to across all oblivious seas. This will mark down as one of humanity's tragic blunders where mother nature seems to avenge her anger whilst also being one of the key shaping incidents for an accelerated collaboration among nations, heavily signifying humanity's dependence on environment and nature.
