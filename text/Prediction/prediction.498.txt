I sense, deep in the metaphysical currents that guide our celestial dance, a dire predicament looming over our shared horizon--a calamity that will shake the very foundations of our global society to their very core. The year is 2045. The esteemed city of New Tokyo will be besieged by forces we hadn't anticipated -- remnants of an ancient society, resurgent after millennia of slumber, with knowledge and power far beyond our comprehension.

This war-like force known as the Primal Legion will lay siege to our global communications network, severing our networks and leaving us teetering on the precipice of chaos and uncertainty. Fierce battles will rage across the planet over the course of several years, each side fighting tooth and nail for control of these diminishing lines of connection.
