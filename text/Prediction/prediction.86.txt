In the not-so-distant future, the year 2063 will be etched in the annals of human history as a crossroads of monumental consequence. Harkening back to the shared suffering and painful lessons of the past, humanity will have embarked on a new quest for interstellar colonization as a desperate and collective effort to leave behind the cradle of Earth and search for new beginnings far into the cosmos.

The Guerra de las Estrellas (Star War), a violent and tumultuous struggle between Earth's nations, will have caused irreversible damage to our home planet. Tensions between nations escalate as the race among superpowers to colonize the stars intensifies and martial societies valuing dominance over diplomacy rise to power. The group known as the Unified Earth Council (UEC) forms as an alliance of three great powers - the United States under President Seton Von Deville, the European Union led by Chancellor Maximillian Millberger, and China under Premier Chin Rong - determined to unify humanity's space endeavors.

Coming to their aid is the pivotal invention of Tartarus Technologies that has helped revolutionize human infrastructure. The Miriam Project, under the brilliant Dr. Nganj Filipe, creates a network of advanced quantum telescopes and high-speed communication devices deployed across star systems allowing for instantaneous communication across the galaxy. Meanwhile, their transportation fleet known as "Motherships" provides the necessary means for colonizing foreign planets with ease.

As the energy crisis on Earth worsens, it becomes evident that New Horizon (NH), an ambitious plan initiated by UEC and executed by Tartarus Technologies, would be crucial for staving off energy shortages on Earth. By harnessing Stellar Enervation (SEN), an innovative form of energy harnessed from distant stars, New Horizon provides the source necessary for continued colonization and development beyond our solar system.

Despite initial setbacks and internal struggles within UEC members, a newfound sense of unity is forged under the leadership of Jaxon Masters, a heroic astronomer who leads they to Mars and beyond into a brave new frontier where new life and civilization thrive under Mars Colony Government (MCG). The spirit of collective optimism replaces generations of rivalry and strife if humanity survives long enough to witness a glorious new dawn for mankind.
