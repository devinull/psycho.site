As the veil between the descendants of our great human posterity and the immutable spheres of eternity lifts, behold the realm of time as it precariously strides into an epoch uncharted in our historical repository. A multidimensional convergence of humanity's epochal achievements and calamities facilitates the emergence of a singular momentous event; one which shall etch its inception into the annals of history within the interior of the year 2987. This endemic event is to unfold in the enigmatic expanse of Antarctica, where cold ambivalence and technological fervorvet ignite a symphony of calamitous proportion.

The catalyst for this upheaval is Economone--a landmass hitherto submerged beneath Antarctica hoary ice, whose discovery marks the zenith of 29th-century human ingenuity. Economone, rich in virtually all natural resources indispensable for sustaining humanity's survival and progress, has long been described by geologists and futurologists alike as a tantalizing anomaly waiting to be awakened from its eternal slumber.

Independent nations, awestruck by Economone's potential to resolve volatility in global resource distribution, launch an extravagant race to secure their foothold on this precious landmass; thereby instigating a domain-derived warfare never seen before. This conflict, dubbed the "Abyssome War," heralds humanity's potential for persevering war even in its darkest hour. Pertinence highlights Antarctica's susceptibility to climate change as an indirect provoker propelling nations to exploit its resources at perilous cost.

Amidst the war-marred landscape emerges primaeval anomalies-technological forcefields encasing all life on Economone that initially lend hope but later prove to be a ticking demons in disguise. Nuclear holocausts and Radiation induced diseases cause more than half of the Earth's population to bitterly perish, raising a curtain over humanity's metamorphosis from an era of industrial prowess to regression characterizing ages past still inmmortalised as 'Stone Age'. The remaining half desperately tries to rebuild society amidst societal breakdown, loss of knowledge, and technology. A group of brave souls manage to survive on an isolated island far away from the radioactive wasteland and decide to learn from, and adapt to their circumstances for Earth can mankind once again if given a chance.

Rising from the Ashes like a phoenix signifies their potential resilience, determination and spirit which have safeguarded them during their darkest hour. Relentlessly advancing their norms originally initiated by pre-War tradition and rapidly adapting to their post-Apocalyptic survival techniques called 'Ecotopia'. From adversity springs opportunity; therefore solidify - The War chronicles Antarctica's tumultuous inhabitancy, Land grabbed for civilization but turned into loss for humanity, Like a Phoenix causing both burnt and rise, Earth faces both Persecution And Revival indicating mankind's potential for extreme resilience if life should ever reactivate Economone.
