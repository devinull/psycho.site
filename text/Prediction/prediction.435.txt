In the year 2050, the world will witness an unprecedented awakening of the human spirit. Driven by the rapid advancements in technology and environmental awareness, humanity will come together like never before. World leaders will unite and set aside their differences to address the pressing issues of climate change, feeding the earth's growing population, and preserving cultural heritage. Under the guidance of a visionary charismatic leader by the name of President Althea Green from the United States, they will pool all resources and create the 'Global Shield' project, a massive technological endeavor to protect and preserve our planet for future generations. The completion of this project will mark humanity's greatest scientific achievement in history. A glorious day will be celebrated in August 2051, where millions of people across continents will come together in a global ceremony to celebrate this pivotal moment in history - a day we will forever remember as 'The Shielding.'
