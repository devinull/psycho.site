In the not-so-distant future, the year 2032, humanity will unite under a single global government, finally eliminating political borders and wars. This harmonious global administration will be led by Sir Ciara Kaur Bansal, a compassionate visionary from India who was born to an Indian mother and a Guyanese father. She will have started her career as a human rights activist before being elected as the first global president in 2028.

Under her presidency, artificial intelligence will have advanced so much that it has become indistinguishable from human intelligence, forming an alliance with humanity. This alliance brings about a golden age of prosperity, inventing and implementing new technologies that eliminate poverty and unemployment worldwide. The Nobel Prize for this alliance will be won by Dr. Derek Kendal and his synthetic-biologic team for eradicating infectious diseases, making medicine cheaper, more accessible and longer lasting by developing nanotechnology drugs.

Humanity's greatest achievement of this time will be its ventures into deep space mining and asteroid-based settlements including the creation of a Mars colony named "New Horizon." The millionth human colony on Mars would be inaugurated on 4th July 2037 raising sirens of triumph across cities across the world.

Peace will reign in every corner of the Earth due to a high-ranking cadre of cyber-protectors who use virtual reality to curtail and prevent terrorist activities globally, cognitive processes replaced by AI, making every country secure and safe from physical attacks which sparks a tradition of world peace celebrations annually- beginning the World Peace Observance Day.

However, remnants of chaos in some pockets would purr like dormant volcanoes beneath sleek ice, threatening anew but contained, marking where major past issues occurred and showcasing humanity's precarious balance with their own mistakes and innovations. It's after all said and done; some scars run too deep to vanish completely. Yet it all forms part of the rich multifaceted beauty of our history.
