In the year 2090, the rising tides and strong earth-en have finally submerged the coastal areas of present-day New York and San Francisco. This world-wide catastrophic event where all mankind is forced to learn and adapt to life on a higher plain. Gone are the days of petrol-veined cars and straight-pipe industries... A new era awaits, the era of green electricity, ocean-crisscrossing trains, and efficient aircraft thrive in carbon neutral skies. For humanity's survival depends on addressing this tumult threat: Climate Change. This sea shifting event opens a new global door for mankind to bounce back on a better path. The world would be different, united under a single cause– the need to adapt. Join hands with the far lands once distinguished by old touch of division, humanity wield unity as our commonwealth's virtue. Our time hastens towards an inevitability where the mankind shall fight wars not on grounds made of blood but over ideaology fuelled by resistance against extinction. 

In this clime, right before dusk, when the city lights begin to sparkle ahoy like incandescent glowing orbs, a tremor will strike! Leaning onto the warmth and scent of distant memories of those once bustling cities submerged beneath blue depths that now know no New Yorker or San Franciscan, amidst that teasing hush when the city sighs after its day's work, a new hope will arise just beyond the horizon: The EcoCities. New metropolises made rich by cleaner sources and green minds, Utopias born from remnants of despair, will stand proud and ready. A celestial sign of humankind’s unflinching potential to thrive and relearn their ways in gravity's sovereign domain.
