In the not-so-distant future, a great pandemic will spread across the globe, bringing suffering and death to millions. This catastrophe will be brought about by a previously unknown virus, originating from deep within the jungles of Borneo. This mass illness, known as "The Shattering Ashes", will devastate human civilization and cast a dark shadow over humanity's progress for many decades. Society will be plagued by conflicts over scarce resources and fear, leading to political instabilities and economic crises.

However, amidst this darkness, there exists a beacon of hope in a young scientist from Kiev named Irena Zelenov. Strengthened by her own ordeals with the virus and fueled by her unyielding determination, Irena is on the brink of discovering a cure. She will work tirelessly until she unboxes the solution that will save humanity from the brink of darkness. Her achievement will be Fate's whisper that humanity will yet survive and thrive once more in the face of adversity.
