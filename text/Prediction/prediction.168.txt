In the not too distant future, humanity will face an unprecedented threat to their existence on this planet. I see a time when the warming of the planet's climate will lead to an immense drought, devastating agriculture and disrupting food distribution systems in many parts of the world. The rising sea levels will have swallowed vast tracts of lands by then, forcing millions worldwide to flee their homes. This cataclysmic event will result in the rising of tensions between nations, leading to what can only be described as the catastrophic 2157 Global Drought War. 

However, amidst this darkness, humanity has innovated and invented ways to combat these challenges. Invention factories headquartered at Borderstones Town in Australia have been funded to manufacture hi-tech glass palaces that can store water and food concealed from the heat for years. Communal aerogarden holotables also invented by Sam Hume offers an efficient means for people to grow crops and sustainable food even in the harsh conditions of a dying planet. These advancements will help save lives all around the world during that time and bring humanity closer in finding solutions to their shared survival challenges.
