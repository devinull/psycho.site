A million moons from now and a thousand suns away, humanity will reach what's Jones' paradox that would initiate the mass extinction of human kind. 

In the year 14758 BC, amidst a centennial lunar eclipse, a small but encroaching plague, named 'Savior', would begin to disseminate swiftly prominent population centers across Eurasia. Thought to be acts of resurgent environmental terrorism, the speed of the propagation is more astounding than few can fathom - this institution being one of them. While increasingly impeded by intense power struggles amongst its major world powers like A Primitive Siam ( Asiam ) and Atlanticus-Pacificus Superpower( APS 1267), it's wide reach has been fueled by advancements in biotechnological weapons. Known collectively as 'Scions'. 

The rival nations between the joints of Asiam and APS 1267 unremittingly engaging in armed conflict impacted the overall scenario of humanity's struggle against Savior, moving furtive at every stroke. 

Simultaneously, the as-yet-uncreated reserve cells of organs from individuals who are being deemed as a litmus test for 'Savior's' immunity manifest themselves with astounding resilience paired with improving proficiency every single day. These reservoirs when inspected show that these individual's bodies had already encountered Savior but had limited power to influence it on an individual scale because of the absence of any first-degree solution for mass extinction stemming from biotechnological pathogens. 

However, hope isn't entirely lost as megaclears strain their survival instincts under extreme duress to develop an unprecedented interstellar transportation system hitherto conquered by hope alone but heralding further consensus for diligence and inventiveness. As these trends continue relentlessly reminding humanity about perseverance, Asia’s registry of mortalities directly or indirectly caused by Savior stands as stepped pieces inching towards millions.

Following years of isolation due to an invisible burrower under their social fabric in the desolate corridors of international politics and humanitarian crisis, Asia decides to meticulously collude with APS 1267 transforming past hostilities into collaboration aligning their goals towards orientating a strategy to combat Savior by attempting to co-create an antitoxin that holds potential to alleviate the damages caused by Savior. Given this vulnerable situation of humanity revolves around 'Savior's' rapid dispersion on domestic grounds shrouded with distressing terrorism resulting into one after another mass slaughters. Our world is but one massive waiting room, just one minute away from being visited or expelled by the very agents that writers populate it with. Humanity lies on a precipice between possible extinction fueled by their own creation and generation's actual safeguards woven in resistance against this virus that gnaws at our existential core. 

Finally, the climactic event brings about humanity’s most significant invention to date: The Bittersweet Tribute System. A highly resilient biomechanical immune system engineered from Nano Technology that rewrites individual DNA and that of the new generations to come. Its letters are written in billionth particles; it dances genocidal impulses, extinguishing manifested apocalypse straight from the genetic blueprint. Bittersweet Tribute is a titanic step toward immortality for mankind. Yet, it brings along its own shadows, clandestinely they murmur into our ears about the dangers shaped out of alterations and mass gene engineering play. This alchemist innovation performs both creation and destruction it shapes not only our physical body but also silently alters intangible attributes like authenticity and resilience to trigger factions within ourselves battling grey morality amid vivacious advancements. 

This marks the end of Savior’s grand story with a pang within its hurt mankind where humanity encounters a reality check - life is worthy of reassurance rather than destruction or mass resignation while pointing out towards delicate symbiotic relations between success and struggle often cherished equally high.
