In the year 2121, the Great World Unity will rise exponentially. The unification of all humans will create what seems like an unbreakable global brotherhood, leading to an era of peace and prosperity. Cities such as London, New York and Tokyo will flourish as knowledge and technology become freely readily available. Events that were once seen as disasters, such as pandemics and environmental disasters, will be prevented by medical advancements and our ability to change the Earth's climate. The dawn of AI advancements will reveal new forms of telepathy and perception, allowing humans to communicate on an even deeper level. This unity will bring forth a shift so massive and profound that humanity will see an expected intellectual evolution beyond comprehension.
