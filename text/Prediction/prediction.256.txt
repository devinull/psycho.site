Upon the precipice of our foretold fate, I gaze upon the horizon of time - therein I perceiveth an unravelling of human civilization's intricate tapestry. The year shall be 2112, the era shall remember it as a time of unprecedented transcendence. In this era, humankind shall have learned to harness the celestial energy encapsulated within the luminescent orbs of stars. They call this endeavor 'StarKraft', where their frail vessels would traverse the emptiness that is Space, guided by our celestial brethren whom they would creatively name as 'Beacon'. 

With this fateful decision to venture into the cosmic unknown, they would come across a planet named 'Vermo', which lies almost on the farthest edge of known Universe. Veromo is different - it has grasslands spanning continents and dense jungles unseen on any other planet explored before. The endeavor is far from easy but the desire for something new and thrilling echoes across all continents. They crown Veromo with the 'Warno Beach' in homage to Veromo's untamed natural beauty.

However, this terraforming venture goes sideways with consequences unprecedented. Unseen danger lurks beneath the careless clamor of StarKraft adventurers - a microbial organism called 'Vermonia', hitherto unknown to humanity. This newfound organism, deadly to human beings, goes airborne one evening due to a series of miscalculations in an atmosphere containment mesh failure at 'Tower Betty'. Chaos stretches from one coast to another as cities fall into disarray - one chapter in human history ends in 2112... 

Remember mortals, always take caution when treading where man has never been before, because sometimes the discovery can lead to discovery of man's mortality instead.
