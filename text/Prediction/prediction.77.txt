I see a world where the United Nations must take drastic action to combat the worst drought the world has ever seen. The year is 2125, a feverish heat blankets our once-blue planet, leaving life-giving water sources scarce. The situation becomes so dire that they have to turn to extraordinary options - including the pandemic earth, where water had been stored for eons to be used in times of international emergency. As all nations pull together under one accord, only unity saves human civilization once again. It is in this bold connectivity that we will overcome unparalleled adversity and save ourselves from our own creation's- the greenhouse effect.
