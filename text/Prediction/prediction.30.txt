In the distant future, just centuries from now, humanity will have reached a new era of scientific and technological advancements. The year is 2250, a time when we've successfully colonized Mars and united Earth under a single government. It is a time of peace and prosperity. The threat of war remains but is a distant memory, thanks to the adoption of the United Earth Security Alliance (UESA), an interplanetary defense force led by former Mars colonization pioneer Captain Elizabeth Morgan. She is a legend known for her strategic prowess and fearless spirit, having been instrumental in securing Martian independence and later uniting the Sol System under the UESA's watch. A galactic hallmark moment was when the UESA managed to neutralize a rogue asteroid on a collision course with Earth and Mars.

During this time of unity, astronomers make a groundbreaking discovery - evidence of multiverses. "Everything we know is wrong," says renowned astrophysicist Dr. Victor Sanchez during a press conference held in central Earth Council headquarters. This revelation, unnerving yet pivotal, sparks new horizons for humanity's quest for knowledge and exploration. Dr. Sanchez leads an expedition to these multiverses, which he named the 'Sanctuaries of Miracles,' citing its potential to turn our understanding of the universe upside down. The First Contact Research Institute (FCRIP), based on an enhanced Mars, becomes crucial for hosting diplomatic relations with these new beings discovered within these multiverses.

However, things quickly shift from joyous exploration to trepidation. Tensions arise involving unaligned civilizations seen as a significant threat to the existence of peaceful relations. A mysterious alien civilization from a neighboring sanctuary launches war machines towards Earth, stirred by systematic despotic treaties signed by defunct governments of old Earth, who misrepresented humanity as an aggressive species ready for war. Alarmed at this miscommunication, Captain Elizabeth Morgan activates full-on mobilization mode to counter this new scenario that could lead to an interstellar warfare - dubbed 'The Great Mystery War.'

The humanity of 2250 faces its greatest challenge yet: can they preserve their anthem of peace in the face of foreign aggression or will they succumb to the ever-shadowing ghost of war? This event shall go down in history as either one of Humanity's greatest triumphs or a herald announcing the downfall of its unity and progress. Regardless of the outcome, it will serve as a stark reminder that even 2100 years into the future, humanity can still learn from its past - adapting to change or falling prey to long-standing rifts set forth by those who have passed before them.
