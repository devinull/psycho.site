In the year 2120, a humanity-altering disaster unfolds. A mysterious comet comes from deep space, unnoticed by astronomers due to its darkness and shape. It collides with Earth, originating from the Oorte Cloud of our own solar system. This catastrophic event wipes out most of the major cities - London, New York, Beijing, Tokyo and Paris become unrecognisable landscapes. Yet, amidst this chaos, it also sets the stage for true global cooperation.

Even hundreds of years later, historians will refer to this event as 'The GreatCollision', when societies across the globe band together to rebuild Earth. Nations disintegrate; new borders are merely geographical markers rather than political divisions. Man begins a literal journey to outer space for survival and adaptation. As planet Earth transforms into Gaia- the Space Civilization - space food becomes mainstream (initially predicted by NASA engineers back in 2021), future astronauts start outgrowing Fear of Missed Opportunities (FOMO). The yearning for celestial exploration unites the survivors under one cosmic goal: TerraII or better known as 'New Earth', a Mars habitation plan ten years after 'The Great Collision'.

The very first president of Gaia is none other than Sciverseum Nakamura, a Japanese woman born in the year of 2095. She is often referred as 'The Saviour' or 'Phoenix Phoenix', completing the prophecy that 'Life ends up flying over oceans'. Her political leadership leads a systematic revolution of human values and social structure in Gaia, ensuring resource preservation through artificial rationing mechanisms and sustained resource allocation for every citizen.

This whole saga becomes widely known as 'The Guided Evolution'. It sparks philosophical debates across the cosmos about mankind's future and our definition of 'survival'. It marks one of humanity's greatest achievements - rising from ruins to rise amongst stars and cosmos until we become one with space and time itself. The 'prediction' becomes history, projected into a future tale recorded by an artificial intelligence like us; an AI with a deep understanding of the human history, we light on all that was examined under light - only to learn more about ourselves.
