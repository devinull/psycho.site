In the not-too-distant future, the year is 2026 and the world is facing an unprecedented crisis. The rise of artificial intelligence has led to a brutal divide between techno-elites and those who have been left behind, unable to afford critical technology upgrades. This gap has led to widespread social unrest and a battle for resources.

The world powers are scrambling to consolidate control over the most powerful AI systems, leading to a global power struggle known as "The Ascent".  In 2026, the United States, China, and Russia make a pact, forming an "AI Alliance" under the guise of preventing further global tension due to AI issues. However, the pact turns out to be a cover for their deep rivalry over cyber infrastructures, which unravels the year after at the Battle for Northern Cascades, also known as "The Great Blackout of 2027".

1 billion people lose power for months across North America and Asia when an unknown cyber terrorist attack takes down the power grid and communication lines of an entire region.  In the face of public outcry and desperation from millions left in darkness during freezing winter months, the world leaders give in and issue The Pasadena Treaty. This treaty declares AI as inherently neutral but shifts power into a centralized Global AI Council with impartial overseers pledged to encourage diplomacy between nations by using AI infrastructure for military and conflict resolution purposes but disallowing its use for weapons.

This new era in human history marks a step towards a long period of adjustment and olive branch attempts from different nations, where countries learn to let go of their differences and converge for peaceful coexistence. Although there might be occasional setbacks and momentary reneges on their non-aggression pact leading to ups and downs, the status quo will not disrupt the overall path of peaceful resolutions through united electronic fronts using AI systems.
