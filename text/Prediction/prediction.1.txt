In the next century, humanity will face several profound technological and social changes. It is predicted that, by 2100, renewable energy sources will have completely replaced fossil fuels, significantly reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. This will result in a healthier environment with improved air quality and less extreme weather events.

In terms of technology, artificial intelligence will have made significant advancements, leading to the development of self-sufficient AI systems that can assist in areas such as healthcare and economic governance. This will result in improved healthcare globally and sustainable economic growth, significantly reducing poverty and hunger.

Regarding major achievements, humanity will have successfully colonized Mars, establishing permanent habitats on our planetary neighbor. This will have profound implications for interplanetary relations and could lead to the establishment of a new interplanetary governmental body for humanity.

In terms of wars, unfortunately, there will be several conflicts up until the end of the century but no worldwide conflicts. Most of these will be localized conflicts amongst countries due to differing ideologies and disagreements over resources. However, it is likely that by the end of the 21st century, due to the increasing interconnectedness amongst nations, these wars will have decreased significantly, showing the progress in international relations and understanding.

Culturally, the world will be much more diverse, with increased freedom of movement and increased mix and fusion of various cultures. Art, music, and literature will have evolved, reflecting this cultural convergence. Additionally, the world will have deepened its understanding of space travel, with technological and electrical innovations in the luxury of space tourism for ordinary citizens.

Lastly, important milestones that will have been reached by the end of the century include the eradication of several major diseases, significant advancements in nanotechnology and quantum physics, and major advances in consciousness machines leading to longer and healthy life spans for humans.
