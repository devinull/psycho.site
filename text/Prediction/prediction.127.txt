In the distant future, on the 9th of April in the year 4567, our descendants shall witness a cataclysmic event of unparalleled scale. Far beyond the reaches of our current solar system, orbiting the planet Xa-Terroph, a celestial body known as Luminous Nova shall reach its peak luminosity, causing an immense solar flare to erupt.

This cosmic occurrence shall capture the attention of all human colonies across the galaxy, casting their skies with a dazzling display of light. The solar radiation emitted by this flare shall overwhelm all forms of radioactive communication, leaving humanity disconnected from one another for a week, unaware of the world's state.

Over a million evacuees shall be found huddled together in an underground shelter beneath the bustling galactic city known as Neo-Atlantis. Herein, they shall find solace in the silence of darkness, sharing stories of their past visions while using absorptive shields developed through decades of intense scientific work.

Simultaneously, on the former tropical island archipelago of Ōsaka-Gaia [remnants of 21st century Japan], vast fields of activity hum with efficiency as transhuman hybrid-androids continue to perfectly replicate every single organ grown within pure carbon fibers. It is here on this comprehensive facility, amidst tropical gardens where hydroponics now yield abundant harvests of rare and exotic bioengineered fruits, that one single trillion-dollar project holds the key to solving Earth's persistent issues with global warming and natural disasters - The Next Wave Genesis Technology Project.
