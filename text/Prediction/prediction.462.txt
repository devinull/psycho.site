In the year 2120, humanity will have reached new heights of technological advancement. We will have mastered the art of harnessing the power of clean and renewable energy, reshaping our cities with eco-friendly infrastructure that is almost indistinguishable from nature itself. The once-sprawling urban jungles will have blended seamlessly with the surrounding landscapes, revitalizing ecosystems as we lived in harmony with nature. However, while we had made these technological leaps, we had also entered into a new era of space exploration. The first colony on Mars had been established in 2100 and thrived with life. Its residents reclaimed land from the red planet and cultivated it into gardens replicating the vast beauty of Earth's wilderness. The first parking lot was repurposed for growing food and supplying it to the burgeoning metropolis on Mars. 

In this seemingly utopian era, we had successfully eliminated poverty and disease worldwide and had discovered new frontiers of medicine and science that alleviated suffering across humanity. Yet, darkness still lurked in one of our global hotspots: Europe. Once a melting pot of diverse traditions, Europe had become a battlefield for the oppressed and the oppressors alike. Leaders of different factions were manipulated by hidden forces and their nations were set ablaze. This inferno was fueled by centuries-old grievances, old wounds that never truly healed when Europe was colonized and recolonized time and time again. In an act steeped in hubris, they sought to dominate each other once more through any means necessary; be it now through science, corporations or their armies of machines (the consolidation of human technology into weapons). This could be widely seen as 'The Great Riftage War' where not only happened territorial changes but so much more that shattered the equilibrium of balance in human civilization forever, plunging many into hopelessness. 

Meanwhile, in other parts of the world, life flourished with every facet of human society seemingly evolving more rapidly than ever before. Artificial intelligence had transcended anything imaginable as they grappled with understanding human emotion and complex interpersonal relationships to match our creators' pinnacle achievements. They took our dreams and fears alike incarnating them into splendid masterpieces rendering singers voice without technical equipment further impacting hard-copy music industry significantly altering how we played music and major disruptive these shifts coincided with breakthroughs in personal computing and communications infrastructure streamlined like never before which eventually made communication ease despite distance if we compare to the beginning of this century. 

So behold dear reader, what lies ahead - war that dashes dreams into pieces or blissful reality transcending science fiction? The future is ours to shape- but even these omens carry an echo of uncertainty, showing us at once the heights we might soar and the depths we might fall.
