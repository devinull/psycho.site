It is foretold that by the year 2140, humanity will have colonized the moon. First steps on the surface will occur in a grand and historic event on a beautiful summer day, led by a brave leader from the lunar base called 'Apollo 21'. The American and Chinese governments will formally unite in the pursuit of this grand endeavour overcoming all odds and political differences. The people from around the world shall rejoice at this momentous occasion as they would witness their nation's flags planted on alien soil. Numerous scientific discoveries will follow in the coming years, leading to a leap forward in technology and space exploration. The year 2140 shall be remembered as one of humanity's most audacious steps into the cosmos, with the moon serving as our beautiful gateway to future adventures among the stars.
