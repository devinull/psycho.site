In the distant future, the year 2121 will be marked by a pivotal historical event called "The Great Renewal." A quantum cataclysm will have left Earth uninhabitable for several decades, and humanity will have fled to Mars, establishing the Martian Human Resettlement Zone. Mars will become a veritable paradise - rich with diverse ecosystems, technological wonders, and abundant natural resources that will solidify their newfound home as the global center of power.

This prosperous age will be ushered in by the dual achievement of a group of fearless pioneers known as the "Comet Raiders," which hail from the remnants of Earth's scientific communities. Amid the backdrop of deteriorating Earth conditions, the Comet Raiders embarked on a daring mission to salvage vital elements needed to reseed Mars. This audacious endeavor was set into motion when they discovered a comet emerging from deep space carrying Earth's last prized natural resources, set to collide with Mars. Perceiving this as an opportunity, they accelerated Martian time tenfold, effectively halting time in their own perception for 30 years and ensuring their accomplishment.

Upon their triumphant return to Mars, their actions are celebrated worldwide. This so-called "Comet Rewards" truly marks the beginning of what will be known as "The Great Renewal." The era heralds a newfound understanding of sustainable living, seamlessly combining human ingenuity with advanced technology in their terraformed paradise. Mars becomes a symbol of civility and cooperation unseen which ushered in a new chapter for human history.
