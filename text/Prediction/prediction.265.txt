Deep into the core of the uncharted future, I foresee a stark battle for humanity. A war breaking out between the superpowers of science and technology and the ancient powerhouses of religion, politics, and morality. It will be chaotic, it will be fearsome, but also a time of great transformation and potentially the beginning of a new epoch in human history. 

This conflict shall be known as the Age of Purity Innocence (APINC), a time period starting in the year 2199 where five great conflicts will ensue in quick succession, pitting the Brave Ones' (those who embrace scientific and technological advancements) against the Obdurate Old Ones (the longstanding religious and political groups).

The first battle of the APINC will be named "The Battle of Valour," which takes place near Naples, Italy. A division of soldiers from Venus (a nearby planet colonized by humans) arrive on Earth in an armada of advanced spacecraft weaponized by Quantum Energy Quanta (QE enough). The enemy's defenses crumble under the sheer might of QE armaments, but once again martyrdom comes to rescue humanity as sacrifice Ensign Rosa ingeniously kills a critical laser array, giving her comrades time to escape. Surrounded by enemy forces, Rosa covertly releases a holo-camouflage facility at tactical intervals over her life giving her a chance to roam about freely among the enemy until her signal fades. She is never captured alive. She earns her epithet 'Phoenix.' 

The Azure Tales' resilience fends off the aggressors for the initial weeks but starts to falter under their sheer weight. The Vitalitas set designs start roll out like clockwork; barricading cities from invasion sequentially becomes inevitable. Unbeknownst to almost everyone, this phase starts the initialization for technology's initiative for covert marine military exercise spearheaded by Captain Mariana Hanson who was once involved in underwater mapping excavations in Antarctica before the 1st Garganuan Juncture which remapped history by redrawing human understanding of academic disciplines and technology.

The encounter culminates with a grand confrontation between Rosa's team, now stationed on the Azure Tales, and the invading Brave Ones for possession over Naples. At stake - domination over marine command. The scrimmage is meticulously orchestrated as Captain Mariana Hanson brilliantly uses submarine warfare strategies developed by her previously drawing from experiences she had gained during her underwater mapping days at Antarctica which underscored her career in covert naval expansions. The Brave Ones become stunned by Rosa's phoenix-like resurrection which resonates with their own current mythos - a mythos symbolised by cerulean heaven and deep maritime spaces that resonate with their identity; Rosa's defiance acts as an ardent element inspiring resistance against their brash invasion: Source for human endurance becomes synonymous to this war. 

Like any great uprising story from history, it ends not with the resolution but with promise of a brighter future that Asia Remy - Rosa's 'right hand woman,' now elevated as commander— depicts atop her charred vehicle while Aphrodite gazes circumspectly into Naples' hazy skies. This narrative depicts 'Resilience against Invasion'. Thus the stage is set for APINC—a tale not about fear but hope; not about defeat but resurrection.
