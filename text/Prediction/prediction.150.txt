- In the year 3025, humanity will have successfully colonized Mars. The journey of human colonization began with the first Mars mission in the year 2050, led by the fearless Terra Nova Corporation. 
- President Julia Morris, an inspiring speaker with origins from Australia, lead the global efforts for this project. James Crawford, a renowned environmentalist and passionate supporter of space exploration, was fundamental in the Mars project's success in obtaining funding and partnerships worldwide. 
- The colonization process was not without challenges. A disaster struck in 2350 when a mega hailstorm struck Mars; devastating many of the early terrforming sites. Visionary intensified under President John Markus of The United Global States Federation, a pioneering government formed after global conflict called The Great Realignment. He worked tirelessly to rebuild and establish new structures on Mars leading to its eventual colonization. 

- The colony was initially called New Earth before being renamed 'The Heavens'. It became a symbol of human ambition and determination to end Earth's vulnerability to natural disasters by establishing homes away from its surface and inspiring unity worldwide. 
- Once established, corporate interests fell heavily on Mars, giving rise to towns known as ‘Filter Zones’. These suburbs composed either of corportwists or workers merely surviving existences marked 'The Heavens'' dark qualities. 
- In 2950, a group of scientists discovered new energy resources after Mars was cracked open along several fault lines leading to an environmental accident causing severe geosystem alterations. This hardship led to 'The Heavens' implementation of zero gravity zones to better utilize their energy resources boldly, leaving humanity with two starkly different habitats: one an improved Earth and the other an untamed monster of chaos.
