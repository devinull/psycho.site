In the not too distant future, in the year 2067, a cataclysmic event will shake the Earth's core. The epicenter of this seismic disturbance will be located beneath Mount Everest, where an ambitious mining operation seeking to extract rare minerals has dug too close to the Earth's mantle. The massive earthquake will render ever-increasing devastation upon the Himalayan mountain range, wracking regions as far away as Tibet, Nepal, and parts of China. The tragedy will claim countless lives and spark a flurry of emergency aid and assistance from global powers, who will work rapidly together to rescue survivors and aid in immediate reconstruction efforts.

In the aftermath of this disaster, a unified effort across nations to curb irresponsible mining practices will take shape. This new alliance, spearheaded by Japan, Germany, and the United States – who find themselves culpable in some regard for the disaster – will devise stringent legislation and new mining standards for countries worldwide. Their mission is clear: to prevent another Everest-induced disaster and protect Earth's loyal inhabitants and all of its resources. The onus of compliance will fall upon countries rich in raw materials; however, these states will graciously accept this responsibility as they realize they need to be only good stewards of their own lands and global environment.

This abrupt turn of events will force a paradigm shift in territorial expansionism. Traditional militaries and global powers' dreams of free-for-all resource exploitation will be shattered by this heartbreaking catastrophe that ravaged Mount Everest. As a result, world leaders will firmly classify certain strategic regions as no-man's lands and agree to voluntary resource sharing among nations. This crisis will be the impetus for a new era of peace and unity. 

Years later, in 2105, humanity will set foot on Mars in a mission of collaboration and cooperation. This mission is not driven by territorial expansion, but instead is aimed at unlocking Earth's second home's secrets for human survival – technology that survives the cruel reality of Earth's unpredictable shifts. Mars will evolve into an interplanetary incubation hub for survival technology and the innovations needed to face our next big challenge - surviving this now extra-terrestrial world named Earth when it becomes severely uninhabitable due to its own internal quakes caused by the same core disturbance. The eventual terraforming of Mars and the establishment of resilient Hümekon Tribe will provide our future generations something to look up to - an enduring legacy that redefines human resilience and unity despite their past missteps in Earth's resources preservation.
