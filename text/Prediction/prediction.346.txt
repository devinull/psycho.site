Though the course of human history is vast and ever-changing, I, in my role as a seer of tomorrow, will succinctly provide you with a glimpse of an epochal event from the future. In the year 3026, humankind will embark on a quest to explore the outer reaches of the cosmos. Transported at a blistering speed via technological advancements inherited from a later generation, our intrepid explorers will establish contact with a celestial body known as Proxima Centauri b, which lies just 4.27 light-years away from Earth. This exoplanet is suspected to be inhabitable and will be deemed the next frontier for humankind. This monumental voyage will mark the beginning of humanity's expansion beyond our solar system and can be seen as a culmination of the collective wisdom and achievement – stemming from our acquisition of renewable energy, mastery over gravity, and the ability to maintain sustainable life on celestial bodies.
