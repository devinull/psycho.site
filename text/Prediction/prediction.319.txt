I perceive a future where humanity has harnessed the energy of the sun to power its machines and buildings. This newfound access to clean energy will revolutionize all facets of life. It is called "Solarian Era". 

Under this new era, it will lead us to World Peace, as nations will be united under the common goal for sharing the energy grid. Solaria Unity Council will be established in Mexico City and it would be a unified governing body for Solarian affairs. The smart solar panel factories will be efficiently running in solar-rich states of Texas and Arizona under a new governmental regime of exclusive technocracy, ensuring faster global transition to this clean energy supply.

However, don't forget the swift onset of an extreme weather events like intense solar storms shall strike Earth causing power blackouts, subsequent food shortage and extreme water scarcity across many regions worldwide, characterizing this period in history 'Era of Darkness' before it led to the World United. And thus to overcome this crisis an inventive entrepreneur Gerard Storen from North Texas devised the backup-power servers running on geothermal energy resilient to such weather conditions which earned him international recognition as 'The Savior'.

So, buckle up humanity for an immensely solar-powered future!
