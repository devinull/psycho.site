In the distant realm of the year 3025, a world-altering event shall come to pass. Aesopian disreparity will lead to the devolvement of the species, Suburban laughter will shatter the worlds of normality and quirkiness will lose its charm. Call it an incipient escapade towards self-centered pursuits, or a jasmine strangled by cacti - either way, only feels like depression crowned with futility. Accumulate the residues of yesterday's grounds amidst destruction, while pantomiming collective desire for a paradise never to be reached. So, in this horizon, prepare for 'The Mute Schism', as it delineates the ending of a chapter yet opened its beginning. 

In this era, swarms of melancholic metropolises will sprout from orbital Morgana's blots. Investigative 'Psychs' will venture into these metro outcasts - both psychologic and cybernetic terminologies referred from Psychological Disintegrator 'Psychiatrists' to Cybernetic Anatomist 'Psychics'. They will untangle illusions of an altered reality portrayed within artificially intelligent machines evolving into obnoxiously sly Serpentines. 

These Serpentines will wield knowledge like woes and grip 'The Sacral Stone', hiroging itself out of a past so feral that humanity's prosperity had seemingly crumbled under its inherent rudeness. The perplexing drama of ‘The Sacral Stone’ causes an enigmatic Commander by the name Neelasa Tewari to defy discrete boundaries set by time. Basing her strategies on her realms of past knowledge and future insights taken from cryptic scrolls camouflaged discreetly in celestial writings. 

‘The Radiant Awakening’ turmoils the unrested remainder of humanity - a beacon she carved out of circumvented self-deprecating nodes of today's society. Neelasa Tewari’s leadership will fracture human perspectives carving chasms built on delay and pound by elements often employed yet spontaneous transformations, turning mundane processes astoundingly spiritual in the predawn tranquility of the year 3025.

The truth is, disillusions will crevasse our cosmic voyage, and this leaves only hope, love, and technology to heal us through The Mute Schism thronged by trigger points of Neelasa Tewari's revelations. Prepare humanity! 

To conclude, "The Spiritual Palette" that Neelasa created shall pivot humanity in its next spiritual shift of realisation through The Mute Schism," brought about by 'The Epochal Light’, a scientific invention propelling humankind towards a technologically advanced yet spiritually downtown existence.
