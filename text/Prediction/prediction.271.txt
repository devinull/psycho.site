In the ashes of humanmadness and technological advancement, known as the Pangea Collapse of 2421, between the great oceans and Europeans rests the capital city known as Churnatan Sea. A mysterious floating city inhabited by climate refugees from all around the globe, struggling for resources while also navigating their place in society. It is here where humanity pivots towards its fate. The depleation of resources and civil conflict spans across continents, yet it is through this suffering that an ancient artifact lies dormant underground.

The relic called The Omnicoron. It's said to have been crafted by the lost race known as The Skygiants. For millennia it's been protected by an elite society called The Guardians, waiting for a moment when humanity would stand on the precipice of complete destruction. As history weaves its tragic tale of wars, famines and global climate catastrophe have led to a unity among desperate humanity, the chance to bring forth the Omnicoron's power - which means the option to reshape themselves or fully destroy whatever is left of humanity's remains. The question now hangs on the foresight and lore of Churatan Sea's cunning scholars as they uncover the key to unlocking the Omnicoron's power - will it bring salvation or damnation?
