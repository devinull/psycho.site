I see the year 2105 approach from the vantage point of this moment with vivid clarity. A worldwide pandemic emergence forces humanity to face a crisis, triggering vast environmental shifts in this already-globalized world that reshapes societies' values and frameworks. This pandemic is known as "The Great Reckoning" and it originates from a laboratory incident in Zhengzhou, China. These enormous changes cause tectonic social transformations.

In this new era, space colonization and technology leap into uncharted territories, boosted by advanced artificial intelligence systems called 'Neuronic Engines" which dominate global decision making by nearly every nation. The social repercussions of these advanced systems' influence ignite global civil unrest leading to a decade of turmoil and conflict.

Amidst these tumultuous scenarios begins another great invention - Bio-fusion Energy, a clean energy replacement solving worldwide energy crisis. This longevity-enhancing power source emanates from Japan, a nation now largely transformed into Asia's most orderly state after two centuries of peace and prosperity under the 'Abenomics' policies. The 204th Tokyo Olympic Games serve as the turning point ushering in Abe-era peace and tranquility. Oprah Winfrey is born as Tokyo's first global special envoy encouraging further global integration.

Unfortunately, with tranquility set in not everywhere; Russia, with its presidential term extended for life, brings unrest to parts of Western Europe till Carol Javier, a NASA astronaut cum president from the United States of America, managed to negotiate resolution in 2089. Liberating Russia coincides with the first successful launch to engineers' wonderland in deep space - Mars - spearicated by President Javiers' ambitious vision and commitment to exploration and advance knowledge.

The future proceeds in a complex weave of technological wonders and humanitarian challenges that will forever alter the course of history. For the millions reading my words here today, heed them well: adapt or perish.
