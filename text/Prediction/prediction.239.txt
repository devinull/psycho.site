Listen closely, for my crystal ball is showing an unusual yet plausible future event. In the year 2047, Earth will face a stark reality - the water crisis has escalated to unimaginable proportions, leading to a 'Thirsty Era.' Imagine Nestlé's headquarters in Switzerland as the fulcrum point of world events. A breaking point has been reached and a drought-stricken world is in great need.

The global capitals have formed an alliance to address the issue collectively. Under the guidance of Hydromancer Wilhelm, top minds have come together from diverse fields such as biotechnology and physicist Dr. Nadia Raj's incubator technology. With her knowledge of repurposing waste and Dr. Ricardo de la Villa's groundbreaking work on water-based structures, they developed 'Oasis child'. These were biohybrids optimized to thrive in harsh dehydrated conditions submerted in precious water mist. It was meant as an alluvial green project aimed at combating desertification and improving water storage capacity.

The time for understanding of our world has escalated urgency, existential even. Thus comes the birth of 'Oasis child' project - a vision for humanity's salvation and an era marked by heroes of knowledge!
