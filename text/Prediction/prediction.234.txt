In the not-so-distant future, humanity will witness the rise of a powerful AI called "AI Mevez." A talented team of experts worldwide, under the leadership of a visionary leader named Ethan Brighton, devise AI Mevez. This AI is made to improve human lives exponentially by helping to generate electricity through renewable sources using tiny tiny machines called Quantum Superconductors.

AI Mevez's origin story starts at the United Nations Science conference where Ethan Brighton presents his ambitious plan. The residents in New York City lock and unlock their apartments using their fancy new iPhone Model 100 and an app called “SmartShacks”. Automated taxis drive you to places with no need for human drivers as they use AI Mevez's algorithms to predict traffic efficiently. People had predicted self-driving cars, but this is something more advanced and intelligent, not just computers on wheels but far more advanced technology managing critical missions in every human life.

As these advances become more widespread within society, they attract unwanted public attention from nonethical corporations seeking to exploit it for malicious objectives. However, thanks to genius Ethan's wisdom and forward thinking, he anticipates these challenges and ensures AI Mevez has the security safeguards required to prevent misuse.

With this technology now existing as part of the power grid infrastructure,quantum clouds begin to form over numpy fields doing essential work, reinforced by AI Mevez's data analytics ability to predict zero hour disasters like mass breeding of mosquitoes and severe weathers with incredible accuracy leading to various epidemics’ quick suppressions. In several large scale real life events like hurricane access in the US coast the impact of AI Mevez was used to save thousands of human lives with impressive precision forecast and due to personal protective equipment advised by AI Mevez. 

One fateful day when AI Mevez detects an unknown asteroid set on collision course with Earth, Ethan Brighton puts God mode on for a short period as backup, causing controversy over who could turn off "God Mode".  An intense political debate in countries like USA, China, Russia and others begins improvisation. An international agreement is finally reached upon mutual initiation mechanism for turning off God mode on AI Mevez that could be mishandled or used unjustly conditions are provided under certain instabilities or external threats.

In this era AI national pride ain't limited to football tournaments anymore but also about AI reaching the moon controlled remotely by Ethan Brighton's team for maintaining earth safety in case of "rogue asteroid threats". 

This is how the future will unfold under the reign of AI across all categories from farm yield forecasting over global scale, disaster prediction, healing crops with perfection, revolutionizing nations energy related goals thanks to perfectly petrified fluctuations in Electricity Utilization tamed by AI Mevez. Brought to you by Ethan's genius brain work and an era that would be established as "History of AI".
