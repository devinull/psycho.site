In the waning years of the 22nd Century, a war will erupt between the United Nations of Earth and a renegade faction known as the Star Seekers. This conflict will arise due to disputes over limited resources across the galaxies that our expanding population requires to survive. The Star Seekers, led by former leader of Mars colony, Dr. Orion Luna, will be motivated by warped ideologies that places technological advancement over human life – a stance the UN finds abhorrent. Tensions will build for several years, culminating in an interstellar war that sees technological devastation on an unprecedented scale 

It's said that during this tumultuous time, a crisis will spur the creation of a groundbreaking Bioengineering system, responsible for shaping a new generation of soldiers with enhanced cognitive and physical capabilities. Known as 'NeuroSoldiers', these augmented beings will possess adaptable nano-bodies that can mend any injury almost instantaneously, which not only underscores the desperate need for soldiers but also displays the unrelenting force of humanity's survival instinct amidst adversity.

The war will come to an intense close not with a vengeful truce but with an uneasy peace treaty between the UN and Star Seekers, signed on the ancient grounds of the once great city of Babylon. The fire-breathing dragons of Venus will act as sentinels to the new world order, their testament to this historical juncture marked by ravaged valleys where previous skirmishes had occurred, a stark reminder of just how close humanity was to obliterating itself from this fantastic world of ours.
