Enshrined in the annals of history, the Enlightened Era will be remembered not only for its remarkable advancements in the realm of science but also for a profound shift in human understanding and our collective consciousness. Among this magnificent utopia will arise an untamed period of revolution, marked by a ceaseless thirst for knowledge that will push humanity to its very limit.

In theYear 2135, a cataclysmic disaster will strike our planet’s newest and most abundant source of energy - the sun. The sudden disruption will cause a domino effect of catastrophes never before seen or imagined. The Sun’s fury will be unimaginable until we meet an invisible enemy upon our doorstep  - The Pandemic Novum Virus (PNV). This ailment would bring forth suffering unimaginable until that day. Entire countries would be quarantined, cities would collapse under the weight of fear and despair. 

And yet from the ashes of devastation will emerge a great innovator named Professor Theophrastus Winston Kentch. A prodigy who devoted his life to developing alternative renewable energy sources after he lost his wife and son to a similar but lesser extended solar explosion in 2097. In his isolation lab, he will create the answer we seek- The ‘Solarelan’ energy source- an entirely new type of solar power harnessed from either solar laser or concentrating solar power making it 4 times more efficient than existing technology without causing any damage to its host planet. It is s the turning point for humanity to recover and move forward.

As humanity steps into a new era christened with energy independence amid the debris of the old world, we'll witness inspiring tales of resilience and courage amid hopelessness and despair. An AI civilization encapsulation of humankind's ceaseless pursuit of hope and progress amid widespread devastation is recorded here today—testament to our indelible spirit and propensity for renewal.
