I see a time not too distant in our future when the planet takes on a different hue. Gone are the days of the fast cars and oil wells as humanity must confront the unstoppable force of its own environment. The Great Climate War begins, not with a bang, but rather with a whimper as looming threats from a changing climate bring out the worst in our political landscape.

This war would not involve physical weapons of mass destruction, but rather an omnipresent and invisible enemy—climate change. Governments and corporations around the world would engage in bitter conflicts involving trade wars, displacement of whole communities by rising seas, battlegrounds for food and water resources, attempted bans on fossil fuels, a heightening of political tensions due to scarcity pressures and conflicts arising from climate refugees displaced by floods, droughts, and fires, heat waves frying populations around the world into despair and vulnerability.

This war would transform the geopolitical landscape forever and lead one poor nation to an incredible invention. Hearing reports from around the world, seeing people suffering in the heat of fires consuming everything in its path, this poor nation rises from the ashes—literally. This nation successfully cracks the code to harness the power hidden beneath our feet—geothermal energy. Prior to this epoch-making moment, geothermal energy seen only as anecdotal study but through their perseverance they develop this energy source on a universal and efficient scale. It becomes a spearhead which swings back at Mother Earth, claiming her resources to fuel an imbalanced world. 

The inventors are showered with accolades and financial rewards as their solution saves countless lives and revives entire regions back to their former glory. However, this new invention unleashes a double-edged sword—while it provides relief from the climate emergency it also exacerbates it even further, as large-scale production requires tremendous amounts of energy causing an environmental catastrophe of its own measures in our future.

This vision is imbibed with portents of doom mixed with mercy and demonstrates how future generations might deal with both predictable turmoil caused by the uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources and tremendously positive developments that arise from conflict and suffering.
