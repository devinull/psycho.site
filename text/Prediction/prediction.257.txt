I foresee a time when humanity embarks on a colossal endeavor to harness the cosmic energies of the universe itself for the betterment of all. By the year 2225, Earth's most brilliant minds come together under the ambit of an unprecedented global initiative called "The Cosmic Harvest" sponsored by an alliance of united superpowers. Under the fiery tutelage of acclaimed astrophysicist Dr. Sarah Lennox (who's descendant from a long line of brilliant scientists); an affable team of engineers led by the renowned Dr. Joseph Harrington create a pioneering technology. An intricate spaceborne apparatus powered using micro black holes: the "Cosmic Meteor Harvester" orchestrated from a secret moon base named "Olympia." The decision was made to salvage debris hurled away during stellar explosions, converting their energy into usable power through a satellite deploying nano-technology. Over time, this technology empowers Earth to become sustainable and to start terraforming Mars. 

The world faced its fair share of scuffles with rebellions from soon-to-be made redundant fossil fuel industries and uneasy alliances faltered due to ideological differences but through collaboration, diplomacy and leadership unearthed in times of tumult; humanity amassed 'Cosmic power', staving off catastrophic disasters with enhanced predictive systems and safeguarding solar flare events while illuminating the world with 'Cosmic-lights', providing energy without the carbon footprint. It was indeed a straight journey, but our heroes prevailed through those dark times, culminating in epochal achievements outlined in celestial histories for generations to come.
