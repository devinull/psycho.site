In the not-so-distant year of 2131, humanity will face a monumental challenge: the extinction of bees. A direct consequence of rampant climate change, the dwindling bee population leads to apocalyptic consequences for food production, agriculture, and thus all aspects of human lives worldwide. Out of sheer desperation to save their own race's vital food source, humanity develops an innovative biohacking solution called "BeeX", a hybrid of artificial intelligence and living organisms that learns to mimic bees' most inherent qualities, including the ability to collect pollen. It's then that our understanding of biology and technology merge in a miraculous turning point, symbolizing humanity's shift from ignorance to dynamic enlightenment and innovation. In 2132, we finally step into posthuman era with BeeX's adoption across fields worldwide & forever transform the history of agriculture.
