In the not-too-distant future, humanity will witness one of the most pivotal moments in its history. I predict a global scientific breakthrough that will revolutionize the way we live and perceive our world. In the heart of the Pacific Ocean, in the year 2075, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Chen Xing of China will discover and decipher the remnants of ancient underwater cities, buried deep beneath the ocean for millennia. The discovery will thrust humanity towards a new age of understanding, as it uncovers vast lost knowledge of our ancestors' civilization that existed long before recorded history.

This discovery will lead to numerous advancements across fields such as spaceship propulsion, robotics, and solar energy harvesting technologies. As a direct result of this event, the manufacturing of ships powered by fossil fuels will halt by 2080 as humanity decides to invest in solar-powered vessels. These new vessels would greatly reduce the environmental impact caused by conventional shipping methods. This situation will force a full shift in world trade patterns determined by geographical distance rather than energy resources. As an example, Australia would shift from shipping wool to China directly, bypassing traditional maritime trade routes further emphasizing regional economic integration within Oceania.

The discovery will also lead to significant societal change as researchers begin the painstaking process of decoding "The Star Maps", a set of documents preserved within these ancient cities. These maps contain encrypted information related to advanced celestial navigation systems that defy current understanding of physics and time-travel theories. This information serves as a catalyst for humanity to focus its efforts on expanding into outer space with speed and precision previously unknown to mankind. The first space colonies will be established within 20 years, providing humanity with a safe haven against potential natural or artificial disasters on earth.

Finally, mankind will begin the process of merging with artificial intelligence through nanotechnology advances spawned from purely organic robots inspired by ancient limestone creatures discovered in the underwater cities. This merger will give rise to a new human species that can dramatically enhance its cognitive abilities and survival skills while navigating life in our solar system and beyond.

I foresee a future plagued with both challenges and possibilities where we embrace our past and evolutionary stumbles to create a brighter tomorrow for mankind's journey into the cosmos.
