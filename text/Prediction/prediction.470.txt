In the not-so-distant future, humanity will experience a groundbreaking discovery that will shape the course of our existence. The United Earth Federation, a coalition of nations working collaboratively to explore and understand the vast cosmos that surround us, will be on the cusp of a monumental breakthrough.

We'll find ourselves at the precipice of unearthing the secrets of a powerful and potentially destructive energy source hidden within the heart of a distant star, lovingly dubbed "The Solace Star" by top astrophysicists. This star possesses both immense potential and danger, holding the key to unlocking limitless energy for our race. Consequently, this discovery marks a new era for humankind, one where energy scarcity will become a relic of the past and our species will take on a new garb of potential.

This wondrous energy discovered within "The Solace Star" will irrevocably alter humanity's worldview and diplomacy. Countries clinging onto their fossil fuel reserves will begin to fight fiercely to control unlimited energy sources, renaming the conflict between nations "The Great Cosmic War," representing the epitome of the tension between countries seeking economic dominance over endless power sources in the universe. The battle lines will ultimately be drawn, inspired not by political ideologies or geographical borders but by accessibility to unlimited futuristic energy. Button will push and drastic incidents will unfold all over Earth. 

Sid Neumann is a key figure in this future war - a UN General assembly member from Norway who is advocating the discretionary distribution of this found energy parameters according to green footprint policy - he fights against any territorial grabs and summons peace conferences hoping talks can precede combat. He'll be seen all over media appeals making a mantra - "This energy belongs to all of humankind". He aims at involving all stakeholders in managing this resource, partly because many communities are yet to be touched by modern energy and his vision won't be fulfilling unless they get their fair chance too. 

The outcome of "The Great Solace War" remains uncertain as it is difficult to predict the balance of power in a clash with stakes this high. However, one thing is clear—the fortunes of each nation will drastically depend upon their ability to leverage this unfathomable source of power. The discovery of this source, and its subsequent demand for control from all corners of Earth, will ignite an era we've never seen before. This revolution in our species' source of survival and development comes neatly within the discovery made by science fiction writer Lem Lemkin who insightfully predicted this Solace Star concept decades ago underscoring his keen futuristic outlook. 

The Great Solace War, though massively sci-fi themed, could well sweep humanity into an era where survival of nations rest not in possession of territory, but rather their capability to harness and utilize energy that lies not just beneath earth but throughout space. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what I foresee - humanities next great future fighting over radiated light from a far-off distant star: The Solace Star!
