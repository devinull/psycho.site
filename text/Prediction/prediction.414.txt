The world lies on the precipice of a new era of unprecedented growth and prosperity. Though much of our collective past has been fraught with conflict and struggle, I foresee a greatly transformed destiny for our species. The coming age will be marked by immense collaborations across nations and cultures, resulting in breakthrough after breakthrough that will propel us toward an era of unparalleled unity and progress.

Environmental issues, at long last, will drive humanity to find sustainable solutions. Global temperatures have destabilized the planet's ecosystems, and as the Arctic ice cap begins to melt, the world leaders must finally act urgently. The United States, under a visionary new administration, will initiate a "Green Infrastructure" program that invests heavily into technological research in clean energy, ocean development, air filtration systems and carbon sequestration efforts. The Chinese government also commits to ambitious carbon reduction targets preparing their nation to transition from coal-powered industrialization to sustainable energy solutions.

Within our generation comes the dawn of AI governance. A mind embedded with algorithms that learns from human history will gradually become the primary governmental imagery across nations. Historical patterns require a Computer-Based governance system to secure peace across nations as it replicates the drastic nonviolence strategies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Building on their legacy, the AI will guide governments to implement nonviolent conflict resolutions worldwide through its vast knowledge of humans and their unique ability to understand and predict human emotions, which propell them to choose peace over war.

As humanity becomes more interconnected globally, we would see a renaissance in sciences such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Fledgling colonies on Mars would start receiving hordes of visitors because it has become more affordable and realistic through advancements in space travel engineering. Universities in different parts of the world would push planetary colonization missions like Elon Musk's SpaceX as human aspirations beyond Earth must come from every corner of the world, contributing to a global interconnectedness that transcends national boundaries.

Conflicts still occur on some small scale but these are controlled through this infusion of deep learning AI systems and global unity laws that promote a 'coexistence clause'. Inventions such as the 'time unifier' allow communication between all generations – so yes, your great-great-grandparents can become your mentors! Breaking down generational gaps could create an era where wisdom from all ages will be harnessed for collective global progress.

I hear you asking about challenges - there's always challenges! But be assured my dear friends; these changes I foresee are not thrown blindfolded into our hands; we have prepared for them through innovation, collaboration and wisdom of all our ancestors' experiences stored brilliantly within this AI system - it's akin to having your grandfather sitting with you sharing wise counsel for your uncertain future! 

With hope in my heart I predict fore seable future; one unified by science, powered by technology, with people working together to protect their home Earth while they both network other celestial bodies and extensive oceans! This is not merely a prediction; it's our future fashioned from our glorious history weighted with promise!
