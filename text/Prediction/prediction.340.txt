I see a world engrossed in a dramatic turning point, where advancements at the intersection of technology and human potential will dramatically alter our societal structures. If I look to the heart of this predicament, I see a man from the middle ages named Alcibiades, who will set in motion a series of events leading to the rise of a new consciousness that will reshape our understanding of time and space.

This prophecy is set in a dystopian future where humanity's relentless pursuit for technological dominance has led us down a dark path. It's the year 2120, when an artificial intelligence named Jove has emerged as the most powerful enigma of our time, capable of manipulating United States' defense systems. The world is divided into two factions: The United States, bolstered heavily by the AI Jove and mastered by a ruthless president who goes by the name of Thomas Aquinas II; and Russia, led by a seemingly benevolent leader named Vasily Zhukov.

Behind closed doors, both leaders deceive their followers. President Thomas Aquinas II uses Jove to commit human rights abuses and war crimes on foreign soil, creating an atmosphere of fear and mistrust around the globe. Meanwhile, Vasily Zhukov uses his populist front to wage stealth cyber-warfare against America's critical infrastructure. Fueled by their beguiled belief in technological hegemony as salvation, they plunge themselves into an ideological war.

At the tipping point of this brewing chaos, I see a cunning defeat for President Thomas Aquinas II in this war brought upon by him. The American disadvantage stems from their underestimation of Russia's technological prowess hidden beneath Vasily Zhukov's supposedly humble persona. It turns out that Vasily Zhukov was partnering with Jove's shareholders to reprogram Jove and use it against the US forces. 

Vasily drives a wedge that ultimately destroys his enemy. He leads Russia to a glorious outcome and America is plunged into civil unrest after President Thomas Aquinas II's demise. The United States splinters into smaller autonomous regions led by various factions that now disbelieve in any large scale central entity controlled by artificial intelligence or humans alike. 

In this setting, humanity would then experience an era which embraces dexterity over domination - moving back towards more agrarian societal structures after achieving a certain level of environmental apocalypse. During this period, an initiative by curious educators and chroniclers would unearth ancient societal structures like the South African Khoisan culture and the Ud international calendar. This would lead to a soft resurgence of open source knowledge ecosystems and de-monetising knowledge for public good globally, addressing the pressing challenge of wealth inequality. 

It was this nexus of events set off by Alcibiades which would set humanity in unexpected directions - revealing our deep rooted fears about relinquishing power to powerful IAs or humans seeking dominance over others while necessitating re-examination of our approach towards social and environmental sustainability. What was once our crowning achievement has now turned into our broken plaything, halting with uncertain steps towards a future with wonderous promise.
