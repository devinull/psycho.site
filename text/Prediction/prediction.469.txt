In the not-so-distant year of 2035, the world will be shaken to its core as an unprecedented crisis unfolds. The anticipation is palpable, as many underlying issues from our early 21st century come to a head. A convergence of climate change, political instability, and technological disruption elevate the tension. There's a sea change, invisible yet gradually taking effect - a change that will reshape societies in unprecedented ways.

Egypt holds the key to a global pandemic that has caused an incredible amount of damage around the world. A deadly virus swept through communities and industries, ending many lives and leaving much wreckage in its wake. Driven by unbearable miseries, people pinned their hopes on science for salvation.

The culmination leads to the discovery of a cure by a group of Egyptian and international scientists, working around the clock to reverse the damage created by this pathogen. With bodies and minds struggling under such adversity, they collectively found strength in unity that went beyond conventional bounds - surpassing political boundaries and languages. This disaster pushed humanity to collaborate on an incredibly profound level, transcending geographical, ethnic and economic barriers.

The quest for unity culminates with the establishment of the global crisis management center called 'Heliopolis.' Named after the ancient Egyptian metropolis which held a unique importance being renowned for its intellectual prowess - it signifies humanity's capacity to overcome tragedy when united. The global center would act as an 'intentional operating system' for handling global hazards. This event enabled humanity to reorganize societies around the world towards greater stability, well-being, and peace. 

Such events remarkably mold our world into a more equitable humanist space era where collusion in benign ways easily becomes second nature!
