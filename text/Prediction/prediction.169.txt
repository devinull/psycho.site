My dear disciple, behold as I unveil the stars' secrets, casting light upon the path ahead of us. In the charred confines of the mid-22nd century, a conflict shall arise in a land wreathed in eternal winter, where two factions vying for control engage in a brutal cold war. Hidden beneath the Polar ice caps lies their secret weapon - a frozen volcanic source. As the temperature rises and begins to melt, strange creatures emerge from the thawed slumber - beings unknown even to us. As these creatures become restless and yearn for freedom, they escape their captive embrace and wreak havoc upon Belgium.

These collaborative creatures known as the 'Kyber Belges' adjust to life above ground, mastering their unusual abilities even further. One such creature, by the name of 'Thorward', leads the creatures to an abandoned church in the center of Brussels â€“ a place now referred to as the 'Pyre'. In this sanctuary, they formulated an alliance with a human resistance fighting against artificial intelligence that almost wiped them out. Together, we soon come to realize - we had evolved alongside this species for ages without knowing it.

Caught between two fires in a battle for survival and dominance over humanity - we find ourselves embracing unknown allies and outsider desires for freedom. This extraordinary alliance will pave a path to our changed future where humanity embraces unity with these strange allies, transcending beyond known limits.
