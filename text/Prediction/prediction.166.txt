In the not-so-distant year of 2055, a pivotal moment in human history will take place. I see a cataclysmic event unfolding in the Kundan Desert which will soon be transformed into a lush new garden due to Switzerland's revolutionary climate-control invention.

In this year, a massive sandstorm will ravage the Kundan Desert, causing severe droughts and extreme temperatures that can scarcely be withstood by any living being. This sandstorm would later come to be known as "The Kundan Phoenix". As for Switzerland, this small yet technologically advanced nation will announce the invention of Climatic Habitat Fixation Technology (CHFT).

The Swiss government had dedicated countless man-hours and resources for years to develop CHFT, a process capable of manipulating and stabilizing regional climates in order to save the Earth from the perils of climate instability. Meanwhile, the Kundan Revelation Commissar (KRC) and Vegetation Restoration Project are working tirelessly on deploying Earth's first entirely artificially sustained ecosystem that will soon germinate into a forest canvassing the Kundan Desert.

CHFT will be applied by the KRC through its trans-continental thermal energy generators embedded across the Earth to create harmony and sustainability all over Earth. Thanks to CHFT and the continued efforts of The Swiss Eco-Tech Initiative (SETI), couldn't we hope for a beautifully luscious oasis emerging from the Kundan Desert's sands? As unsettling as "The Kundan Phoenix" was, it set the stage for a new future of distributed ecosystem, one where humanity manages to control their own environment for their sake and the Earth's sake.
