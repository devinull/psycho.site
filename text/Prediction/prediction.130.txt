I foresee a time when humanity will embark on an unparalleled exploration of the cosmos. The seeds of this endeavor will be sown when, under the leadership of a brilliant entrepreneur named Amara Shivani, humans first take off to Mars in 2033 on a mission that the world has come to celebrate as "Mars 1". Amara will have an incredible vision and her charisma captivates everyone's hearts, making Mars 1 more than just another mission but a symbolic event in humanity's drive for exploration and discovery. 

Amara's leadership sets the pace for the global community to expand their investment and interest in space exploration. In this new era, humans will develop advanced interstellar colonization capabilities around mid-century around 2050. The New Herd Telescope (NHT), developed after much collaboration between world power countries like USA, China, India, etc, will work alongside Mars 1. They will work together towards the common aim to further explore extraterrestrial life by finding signs of life on Europa and Enceladus.

The collaboration among nations marks a monumental shift in global politics.countries are working together towards a shared goal of exploring new frontiers in space. In this new era, Mars 1 sets the foundation for humanity to make their bold steps beyond our galaxy, a prediction I see occurring around 2100 , where humans for the first time will start terraforming distant planets such as Kepler 22-b and deepen their grasp on scientific exploration. The outcome of this will result in endless possibilities for humanity as we become multifaceted creatures moving from terrestrial beings to becoming cosmic beings.
