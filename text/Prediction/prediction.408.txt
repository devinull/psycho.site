In the year 2147, a great technological event shakes the world. The closest descendants of humanity at that time, known as the Genesis Generation, have developed a way to harness the energy of celestial bodies which they use to create advanced machines capable of achieving unprecedented advancements in technology and climate control. However, with power comes division and conflict, leading to a large-scale war known as "The Stars War." The war rages between two factions: The Celestial Mission, who are eager to use the power of stars to spread their reach across the galaxy, and The Terrestrial Union, who want to focus on Earth's climate, resources and reviving its ecosystem. The war is not short and bloody like many previous conflicts; it leaves lasting damage on Earth, but ultimately leads to an era of renewed peace and prosperity. In 2150, an international charter is signed by all factions where all war-type machines and the abilities to harness celestial bodies are banned. Existing machines àre rendered harmless. Instead, the focus shifts towards creating sustainable technology, leading to the golden age of renewable sources of energy on Earth and space exploration reaching thousands more celestial bodies.
