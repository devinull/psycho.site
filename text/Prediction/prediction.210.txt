In the year 2120, a self-proclaimed hero named Captain Elara Rong will set out on an urgent mission. This environmental crusader will leave the safety of her home planet Uriel for the far ends of the cosmos. 

She's called into action, joining three like-hearted rebels to explore uncharted outer-galactic spaces. Together, they will discover the tantalising Atlantis 2.0, a long-lost but perfectly symmetrical civilization, deep beneath hostile territory. The mission of this elite group proves to be one of historical rediscovery and earth-changing cooperation.

The year 2142 sees unforeseen advancements in technology transpire into world diplomacy. Peace between nations has been at an all-time peak hitherto unknown, but due to these advances in communication, even previously untouched regions become part of the globalized family - helping construct a utopia where all nations share resources, entertainment and lifestyle freely, eliminating poverty and capitalism as bygone eras.

However, around the year 2150, tensions between nations rise due to unforeseen changes in climatic conditions that disrupt agricultural productions causing widespread hunger, leading to clashes for limited land and water resources. The accumulating crisis creates global unrest and violence been witnessed never imagined of before! In response to this chaotic situation, a lighter-hearted but efficient solution to this hunger crisis introduces the invention  "Foodi-Matics". These futuristic gadgets were designed by a joint effort from scientists from struggling countries which have been an ingenuity's utopia thus far. The "Foodi-Matics" can synthesize perfectly natural food substrates guaranteed non-GMO with minimal need for fertile agricultural land or water resources and it also uses solar power.

Finally, by the year 2200, a sense of fulfilment and peace galvanize the Wise collective due to technological evolution and human advancement. As we progress towards this distant yet exciting reality, these events will shape our collective future as humans. Remember, the starless night holds all wisps of prophecy ready to be birthed as reality when its time comes.
