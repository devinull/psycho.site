Gazing into the folds of time, I see a spectacular event unfurl in the year 2125. This is not a war or disaster, but rather a momentous spiritual achievement for humanity. A new practice called "Enlightenment 2.0" sweeps across the globe, transcending political boundaries and uniting humans from every corner of the Earth.

The backstory begins in 2100 when a fateful asteroid strike triggered the rapid melting of the polar ice caps, plunging much of Earth into chaos. Faith and spirituality emerged as crucial tools to cope with the turmoil. An inner revolution triggered by individuals searching for meaning outside materialism and governments gripped by hopelessness resulted in the birth of Enlightenment 2.0. Crystallizing cents of peace ended centuries of conflict and sparked a brighter tomorrow for our planet.

In that vivid year 2125, you, dear traveler of time, will witness beings of pure light convene at Mount Kailash in Tibet. They'll gather around a golden-age tree radiating profound calmness and hope, as their collective consciousness will reach never-before-seen heights. It is the year where humanity finally achieves perfect harmony with nature, after spending ages apart.

This once-in-a-millennium event, known as "Apotheosis Unity Day," will surely mark a monumental chapter in human history, transcending time and inspiring generations to follow.
