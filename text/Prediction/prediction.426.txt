In the not so distant future, around the year 2150, humanity will face an unprecedented crisis that will leave millions in despair and trigger massive upheavals across continents. The conflict, known as The Great Allignment, will erupt due to the unexpected destructive capabilities of a newly-discovered comet named "Luminous Antares."

The year prior to this apocalyptic event, scientists had detected Luminous Antares approaching Earth at an accelerated velocity but dismissed it as an isolated phenomenon. What they didn't anticipate was the degree of severity Luminous Antares could unleash when it finally intersected with Earth's atmosphere. The consequences were catastrophic – widespread devastation, power outages, and tsunamis. Millions lost their lives and infrastructure was rendered irrelevant overnight.

As devastation and chaos reigned, nations that once stood as empires came together in a desperate attempt to bring some balance back into their lives. The leaders of USA, China, India, and Russia would hastily form the International Union of Survival, vowing to bridge political divides to save humanity from further insidious encounters from outer space. Their mission was nothing short of survival for mankind.

Fueled by fear but buttressed by hope, they decoded remnants from NASA's archive about this celestrial mystery called "Luminous Antares". They discovered that Luminous Antares was not natural – it was engineered by an advanced alien species to guide galaxies through cosmic alignments. The aliens were called 'The Astrals' and they had used this comet as part of an advanced cosmic weapon system to unravel civilized galaxies across time and space.

The intensity of the force would reduce periodic volatility maintaining regularity in the galaxy's alignment, acting as both an alarm clock and a space harmonizer. According to intercepted transmissions from the Astrals, it was all part of their efforts to maintain 'cosmic equilibrium'. 

In response to the comet's attack and desperate to fortify their defenses against any further encounters with extraterrestrial weaponry, humanity adopted new ways of life: green energy became commonplace, space exploration was accelerated exponentially, and survivability-based manufacturing became mainstream. Human civilization limped back from the brink of extinction gradually but surely over centuries after the Great Allignment.

History describes this as the birth of a truly united Earth repositioned in global awareness as 'The Post-Luminous' era where technology and science replace ideological confrontation. The climate of cooperation ushered spy-cameras woven into clothes substituting for police stations, solar-powered cities bathed in eternal green energy harvested from the rays of Antares, replaced vaporous diesel puffs with sustainable eco-systems, and with established travel corridors to other galaxies made friends with 'the Astrals'. The bitter chill of destroyed civilizations metamorphosed into gold robot technology contours brushing away every scar left by The Great Allignment. The human story was not simply about survival but about growth despite adversities charting course into uncharted realms which is now known as 'The Great Expansion'.
