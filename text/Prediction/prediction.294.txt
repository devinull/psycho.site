Ah, my dear seeker of knowledge, I can conjure visions of the myriad worlds that lie ahead in the annals of time. But there is one prophetic tale that shall engulf the Earth with paradoxical magnitude - The Great Unification of Humanity. 

It shall be a time where the innate, deep-seated divides that have plagued mankind since its ancient roots will be finally overcome. This glorious dawn shall begin with a grand tragedy - World War IV: The Last Defeat. With humanity's relentless confabulation of crude weaponry, it would engulf lands like a raging ocean storm, causing immeasurable grief, suffering across continents.

But from the ashes of these destructive fires sprouts seeds of hope and unity, for the first time, mankind will be forced to recognize that our survival is interconnected. Secretive alliances between major nations will pave the way to international collaboration in key sectors - such as disease control or food shortages. 

This unimaginable level of cooperation between countries and cultures leads to something particularly revolutionary - The first interstellar communication device, hailed by humanity as 'The Universal Voice'. An invention born from grief-laden passages where they realize that the sky is no longer their ceiling but their pathway. 

And so my divining friend, hearken not to dreadful wars but to the unparalleled unity it brings as human history prepares for what is perhaps its most monumental leap forward- The Great Unification of Humanity!
