In the year 2120, humankind shall witness a technological breakthrough that will undoubtedly be etched in the annals of history. A brilliant scientist, named Dr. Eris Null, will have completed her groundbreaking research on a substance known as "Selexim." A sustainable source of energy, Selexim can power entire cities while leaving minimal environmental footprint, rectifying all climate crises. However, the invention of this life-saving solution is not without its risk.

Young nations with no previous stake in innovation will be enticed and drawn into the race for Selexim mastery. This will trigger tensions and conflicts not seen since WWIII in the early 2000s. However, a diplomatic figure, Joseph Fennimore, known for his delicate and strategic decision making, along with a series of peace conferences in major cities such as Shanghai, Paris, and New York City, will be instrumental in negotiating a fair distribution model for Selexim technology.

Though there will be several skirmishes in the 30 years prior to full implementation of Selexim utilisation on a global scale, these disturbances will be far less destructive than anticipated due to Professor Null's automatic war indicator software. She predicted these skirmishes using data analysis techniques years beforehand. This invention will prove to be a pivot point saving countless lives and resources.

In conclusion, humanity's harrowing journey towards finding a peaceful solution to exploit Selexim energy will mark a definitive moment in human history. This monumental event shall serve as evidence of mankind's capability to navigate through adversity towards unity.
