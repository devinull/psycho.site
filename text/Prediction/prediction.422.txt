In the year 2057, humanity will face a crisis of unprecedented proportions. A catastrophic event known as "The Great Climate Collapse" will shake the very foundations of society. The northern ice caps will completely melt, causing vast parts of coastal settlements to vanish beneath the waves. Most of the cities located on low-lying ground, like Shanghai, Tokyo, and New York City, will be engulfed underwater. Millions of people will be displaced, leading to unprecedented migrations across the globe.

As temperatures continue to rise, an unprecedented drought - aptly named the "Desiccation Decade" - will make much of Africa's and Australia's fertile lands uninhabitable and arable crops either scarce or extinct. The ensuing competition for precious resources will ignite a series of wars that we now call "The Last Flame War." This brutal conflict will involve not only nations but also powerful private corporations who have established their own mini-states amidst the chaos. Professed neutrals like Switzerland and Sweden will find themselves drawn into the conflict by their desperate populations seeking refuge and an end to the madness.

Just when it seems like humanity's destiny is written in the stars, a rival civilization - the nomadic "Tethyans" residing underwater northeast of the Mariana Trench - will emerge from the depths. Intrigued by mankind's descent into chaos, they devise a daring plan: to catalyze human innovation by offering technological assistance in return for access to resources such as plastics and certain rare metals required for their subaquatic civilization. They offer their state-of-the-art underwater technological systems as examples: advanced bioengineering and oceanographic technologies that resulted in vast underwater cities and reliable crop growth systems.

The result is a crescendoing convergence of global progress, spearheaded by joint collaborations between both civilizations that lead to spectacular innovations: renewable energy sources that transform the world, global smart grids that ensure equal distribution of resources worldwide, and teleportation technology that eventually allows people to move anywhere instantly anywhere on Earth. Humankind manages to survive this onslaught of adversities through sheer tenacity and determination by learning from both its destructive past and its cooperative future. Thus begins a golden era for humanity as it embraces its dual legacy of destruction and creation culminating in a world much more diverse and resilient than ever before.
