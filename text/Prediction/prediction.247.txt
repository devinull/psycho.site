In the year 2176, a time of great turmoil and upheaval, the remnants of the once mighty United States unite in their fight for survival against a rising global hegemon known as "The Plain Empire". The Plain Empire, a vast and hot region once known as the Sahara, has become a global powerhouse through its harnessing of solar energy, producing an army of mechanized warriors armed with solar-powered exosuits. As the leaders of The Plain Empire begin their conquest of Earth, creating a new world order where all must bow before them, a group of American scientists set out to build a spaceship that can take them to a distant planet called "Paradise Prime". Upon reaching Paradise Prime, they encounter an alien species known as "The Living Crystals", who offer to share their knowledge of interdimensional travel. With this newfound power, the United States leader reunites Earth's scattered nations for one final battle against The Plain Empire. With immense courage and the power of the Living Crystals on their side, they launch a counter-offensive, utilizing new technologies obtained from the Living Crystals to turn the tide of the conflict. After a fierce space battle and a colossal ground war, The Plain Empire's nuclear arsenal is destroyed by Earth's combined forces in an alliance witnessed across the galaxy. Peace is reimagined with unity and cooperation becoming humanity's guiding principles once again.
