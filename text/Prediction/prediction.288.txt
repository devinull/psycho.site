In the distant realm of human progress, where the Atlantic heats up geothermal energy from the churns beneath the Caribbean and Antarctica freezes the planet's southern pole into the coldest place on earth, human civilization will experience a turning point of chaotic events. The year is 3569 and many significant global wars have settled down, transforming partially into trade wars and a quest for technological superiority. 

This is a time in history when humanity will attempt to make another leap into outside influence by going to Mars simultaneously. This era sees two powerhouses — the United World States, composed of the remnants of North and South America, and the Asian Federation led by revitalized Japan and China — spy on each other's colonies fixed on the red planet. 

To counterbalance this silent surveillance, both superpowers come up with building a defense system based on "Advanced Proven Ground Artillery AI" aiming to control the lunar orbit for weapon management. The term 'AI' indeed forebodes a far different operation than we can imagine, but the basic intention remains to keep peace and eye on competitors in this tri-planetary affair. 

This place of truce is unstable. Concurrently, one unforeseen calamity stumbles upon them: a plunge of catastrophic magnitude into Mars's atmosphere in the form of iceberg fragmentation from asteroid defit, splattering into discordant truth as both superpowers blame each other miserably; confusion trumps logic. 

Simultaneously, an unforeseen accident propels a new inflationary discovery into the forefront of physical sciences: a biosynthetic compound undulating from Mars eons ago which may act as a potential solution not only to human health issues but also to fast-tracking agriculture which may win these superpowers the profile of ultimate powerhouses-cum-providers by making them self-sufficient and globalthly viable due to market control. 

This delicate balance signifies more than an new Olympic game. It portends immensely high stakes. It’s proof that humanity finally ventures not just onto other planets but into their own boardgame of success and chaos where every shadow moves toward dominance while every glimmer flares toward peace.
