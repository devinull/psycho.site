In the not-so-distant future, humanity will witness a momentous turning point, a singular event that will change our very existence. In the year 2042, on the 24th day of September, a brilliant mathematician and physicist named Dr. Isabella Fernandez will invent a groundbreaking technology called "MetaPhase." 

MetaPhase is a device that utilizes quantum entanglement to manipulate time and space at a microscopic level. It has the power to reverse the effects of natural disasters, prevent The Great Pacific Garbage Patch from growing larger than Texas, and halt the decline of Earth's plant life – honestly, the possibilities are as vast and interconnected as the universal fabric itself. 

But not everyone will appreciate Dr. Fernandez's invention. A group of powerful corporations, who have amassed tremendous wealth exploiting Earth's resources and secretly developing MetaPhase-enhancing weapons, will feel threatened by this new power in existence. A war will break out in the year 2043 – "The War of Weltquanten Manipulation," it shall henceforth be known – with a call to arms echoing through every civilization that possesses MetaPhase devices. 

Cities crumble under the anger of MetaPhase waves, and nations become roommates as borders dissolve under the shared destruction. The war goes on for seven long years before peace makes its gradual presence felt in 2050 with nations coming together under an uneasy alliance of humanity to protect their vision of "the future" with MetaPhase at their fingertips. And so, in the year 2050, we'll see a race among nations to develop new applications for MetaPhase technology – engineering a more balanced world than ever before.
