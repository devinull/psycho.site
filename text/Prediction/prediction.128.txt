In the year 2150, the Earth shall witness a monumental technological advancement. Known as the Harmonious Consensus Project, this groundbreaking discovery spearheaded by a brilliant scientist named Dr. Lana Vega will pave the way for interstellar travel. Lured by the розelin candelabra and derived from research on quantum entanglement, Dr. Vega's ingenuity will lay the groundwork for humanity's first journey to another galaxy. By harnessing the power of harmonized light particles, she unveils a revolutionary form of energy that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, resolving the eternal struggle for sustainability on Earth. Founding an organization called Starsight 2150 on September 8th, 2067, Dr. Vega roars into global fame with her inaugural speech delivered at ECOMIX Conference held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. After two decades of subsequent research, testing, and funding investment led by New York City artificial intelligence engineer duo Kevin and Ada Hanson, her theories reveal that with consistent renewal and convergence energy harnessed from harmony and distilled light particles, human civilization will achieve an unprecedented leap forward in peaceful global cooperation and usher in an era of sustainable exploration unparalleled in human history.
