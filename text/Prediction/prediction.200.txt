"In the year 2115, I perceive a great upheaval occurring on Earth. The world's population has grown too great for its own good. Overpopulation has caused strain on resources and led to the brink of mass starvation. Tensions climax in Mexico City, where a megacity of 32 million people crashes into utter chaos. 

The United Nations, spurred into action, appoints a global task force to combat the overpopulation crisis and facilitate the development of new agricultural capabilities. Scientists harness long-ignored yet abundant capabilities of our oceans and seas with new underwater cities emerging in designated sites across the world. 

By 2150, all nations live in these immense underwater cities connected by speedy underwater transportation systems and superfast internet. There are even underground farms that grow food with minimal water usage, solving the food crisis. The UN divided into several branches and evolves to become one of the most powerful entities on Earth."
