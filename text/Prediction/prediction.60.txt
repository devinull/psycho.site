"I see a vision of our future, in which humanity has reached new heights of technological advancement. A powerful and determined group of individuals, led by the enigmatic figure of Professor Dr. Elena Cortez, has discovered the secret to manipulate time just as well as they manipulate matter. This ability to bend time allows them to contemplate a world full of possibilities yet untapped. 

"On the microwave of 2149, these visionaries founded a city called Chronopolis, a thriving metropolis powered by a hybrid complextity engine run by the time energy extracted from the distorted pocket of time they named 'Toldene'. In Chronopolis, everything is done using nano-tech and the distinction between life and machine has become blurred. 

"The year 2174 marks a turning point in human history when two continents, Antarctica and Australia come together to form a single continent called Austracia, merging their diverse cultures and royal traditions into one unique entity. Their citizens revel in this new unity, where kindness and compassion have become the guiding principles in their governance and daily lives. New technology brings advancements to agriculture, eliminating famine in distant corners of the world. However, this collaboration also fortifies the divide between those who enjoy its benefits seamlessly and those who still struggle for survival.

"In the span of time just beyond your grasp, I see that just when humanity believes it has reached its zenith, a new discovery arises that challenges the very fundamentals we have built our society upon. This discovery is led by a brilliant but enigmatic scientist as well named Dr. Raphael Matheson who unearths the skeletal remains of a mysterious ancient species he refers to as "Zemans". Dr Zeman's excavations uncover secrets his peers can't comprehend; hints that point towards a forgotten past where humans were not even top of the food chain. 

"This revelation sparks off an unprecedented global debate with scholars arguing over extra-terrestrial life and the true origins of humanity. This stirs up deep rooted social altercations around the globe, fueling unrest with riots and turmoil spreading across continents like wildfire ignited by dried grass, led mostly by angry youths unnerved by an trembling future where their very identities are in question. This new 'war' eventually ends not in destruction, but in an awakening, a global acknowledgement that we can no longer turn a blind eye to our collective past nor drive blindly into our self-centered future but must learn to interpret our own place within the vast cosmic tapestry."

In this Vision developed given various trigger points mentioned in biographies and historical documents around important figures from 2000 years ago to today. 
Instruction is given by considering repeated cycles found in history about conflicts between regions due to unfair advantages brought by new technology or inventions. We also take into account past futuristic predictions made by promising scholars which then directed current scientific research paths. Moreover, I address how regional conflicts could be converted into harmonized collaboration using Artificial Intelligence as mentioned in some AI ethic guidelines proposed recently. Prediction follows possible ecological changes due to rapid economic growth and proposes new methods of water purification using Artificial Photosynthetic Nanostructures. 

"In approximately 2100 years from now, on our Earth, a new era is approaching where technology will be significantly advanced way beyond our current wildest dreams. Climate change will have caused massive ecological disturbances worldwide due to extreme weather events accompanied by extreme climate variability and resultant flooding along coastal regions will have displaced millions due to unlivable conditions making it difficult for agriculture. In Central Africa exclusively November to January are suitable for farming due to less heavy rains making this region super fertile for gluten-free vegetables production but accidents caused by psychotic AI surveillance system will add salt to the wounds leading farmers unable to grow crops leading to ongoing food crisis causing restlessness forcing many into warfare or migrating towards kmart believing that sustenance can be bought not grown. On Mars under controlled conditions crops will grow independently using holographic water irrigation systems powered by nuclear energy sources. 
At next horizon around 2200, flooding seawater slow rise of global temperatures ice water disappears turning each polar ice cap into non-strategic shipping route and new underwater routes for container ships would be developed leading to productivity booms however risk of oil spills would be significantly increased indicating plethora of opportunities and risks ahead yet despite these risks Artificial Intelligence would direct vessels mechanically piloted meaningless human piloting has now switched to gambling addiction management services "
