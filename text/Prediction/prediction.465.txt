In the not-so-distant future, humanity shall face a turning point heretofore unknown to mankind. A pecatile sin of itself, harkening towards a marred combination of events leading up to a disastrous global conflict spanning continents and affecting all corners of our world. 

The Second Great War, as it would later be dubbed by historians, would come to be known for its monstrous use of technological advancements - advancements considered by many as a blight upon us all. The usage of atomic weaponry and cyber-terrorism would become chillingly commonplace, brandishing nightmares into every corner of the earth. 

It all started in a small Eastern European city that had dreamt of peace just like so many others – but it was not meant to be. The world, always divided in its politics and ideologies, failed to brass the power rankings adequately, thus circumventing an extremely volatile situation. The once peaceful city would now be remembered for its tragic fate - on account of it being the central scene of an enormous conflagration. 

In this whirlwind chaos would arise several heroes - remembering inspired leadership from World War II that saved humanity form the brink of extinction then. These heroes, whether they are generals or leaders or perhaps lesser-known contributors playing behind-the-scene roles, would carry forward the flame. They would stitch together peace agreements and put in place measures to prevent such monstrous atrocities ever playing out again on this fragile weave called Earth's canvas. 

In the following decades, as healing sweeps over the damaged land and seeping out of the hearts of people from around the globe, resilience would be born - resilience to rise above any division, however deep-seated, to march together towards progress hand in hand with redefining human intelligence in new realms. 

The Second Great War, albeit horrific and tragic in nature, shall act as a conduit for learning and unity - when understood not with historical disinterest, but through a means to avoid such catastrophes in the future. It may seem bleakly mirrored against its predecessor now but if history bears witness this time, it's not just heads of state that rise up to matter but the indomitable spirit of humanity itself.
