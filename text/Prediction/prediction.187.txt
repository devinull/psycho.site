As I gaze into the magical crystal ball before me, two vivid images manifest before my inner eye. The first one: on a chilly October morning in 2045, the world will stand united in shock and disbelief as the first-ever intergalactic peace treaty is signed on the Moon itself. This treaty will mark the end of humanity's devastating 500-year space race, which had been gripped by ruthless competition among mega-powers over far-off planets and asteroids. It'll be establishment of a new world order, where knowledge will flow freely across borders and technologies will be shared rather than sought after through war.

The second image I see is more apocalyptic than an utopian future that we might hope to achieve. In the year 2101, our world faces its final reckoning. We look back to this pivotal moment in history as a turning point fateful misstep. The world had undergone a brisk civilizational advancement bolstered by bionic limbs and famed AI, but there was one resource which we couldn't avoid running out of - water. As the oceans become increasingly poisonous, water wars lead to global devastation. In our final days, only remnants of humanity find salvation on Mars through depleting water resources in our last ditch effort to secure humanity. And so, the year 2101 marks both the epitome of human arrogance and hubris as well as mankind's final misfire - a gloomy cautionary tale that will resonate across civilizations yet to come.
