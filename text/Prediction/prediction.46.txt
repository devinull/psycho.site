In the year 2167, the once-prosperous and fertile land known as the United States will face a catastrophic climate event that will forever alter its landscape, and indeed, the course of human history. The Grand Canyon, a marvel of nature, will become the epicenter of this horrific calamity. A massive solar storm will collide with Earth and wreak havoc across the vast expanse of this beautiful nation. My powers reveal to me that this storm will create incredible amounts of heat, destabilizing the atmosphere and generating powerful winds that will rip the land asunder.

I see oppressive heat barreling down upon the lush greenery of Washington D.C., drying up the vital water sources and further weakening an already crisis-ridden drought-stricken area. The Potomac River will be reduced to a mere trickle, even as its water is capitalized on for survival by those who remain in its once-thriving metropolis. Despair will settle over the mercilessly divided city, exacerbating the already-palpable discord between its people.

It's notable that I perceive one spontaneous flash of hope. A lone inventor, known to me only as "Theodore Larkin," stationed himself in Albuquerque, New Mexico during this devastating time. His great invention – an electromagnetic field generator – temporarily blocks the intense solar energy emission before it reaches crucial life support and infrastructural systems. With a desperate surge of creative brilliance, he manages to salvage not only Washington D.C., but also several other cities across the nation. An era of mourning turns into one of resilience and determination for humanity.

This, my friend, is what I see for our future. The very heart of humanity will experience a grand transformation while inseparable obstacles come to test human resilience and unity the way no force ever has before.
