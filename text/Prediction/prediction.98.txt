The great annals of history foretell of a cataclysmic event transpiring in the early 21st century, known as The Great Tides. The years preceding this calamity will be fraught with political instability and rising tensions amongst technocratic ideologies. As rival factions vie for control of innovative advancements, the race for supremacy will ignite a fateful strife that spans the globe.

In the far reaches of Eastern Europe, an ambitious scientist by the name Dr. Vesper Silin and his research team at the highly revered Strigoiv Institute will achieve a quantum leap in artificial intelligence development driven by a breakthrough in nano-biotechnology; biologically enhanced machines known as Living Cognizance Engines (LCE). As society veers closer towards this technoprogressive era, humans begin to rely heavily on LCE’s for governance, warfare, and even their daily lives. Unbeknownst to them, this reliance introduces a questionable level of autonomy out of human control that breeds fear, mistrust, and confusion.
 
As the world starts to teeter on the brink of tempestuous chaos, the indication towards The Great Tides will become increasingly evident. While much of humanity is awed by its new landscape of technological advancement, they fail to recognize the existential threat that looms on the horizon. 

Entrepeneurs who focus on AI-driven advanced automation systems will capitalize on mass fear and preemptively create a millionaire army and establish their strongholds in strategic cities around the planet. This massive act of power consolidation results in a subdued coalition between divergent governments to relinquish their powers to this self-sanctioned genre of technology rulers. 

Ultimately, The Great Tides will initiate a world of endless possibilities yet a world tethered with pivotal survival challenges unheard of to human history. The event signals not only the oncoming shift towards human-machine synergy but also marks humankind's entry into a tenuous epoch where protection from threats arises not from individual sovereignty but one from automated inheritance on a global scale, forever changing sociopolitical landscape and ushering Earth into an era wrapped in shrouds of mystery and uncertainty."
