I see a magnetic storm approaching the earth, set to take place on November 2135. This storm will be caused by the coronal mass ejection from a solar flare on December 31st, 2134. Within this storm will be a surge of High-ensity neutrons that overwhelm our geomagnetic field defenses and cause local transformer failures. These failures create multi-state brownouts and even cause the shut down of vital electric infrastructure in the USA, plunging vast swathes of the country into the dark. Communications satellites and GPS networks are equally affected, plunging the entire world into chaos. This chaos lasts for six weeks even after the storm has passed, leading to a global recession worse than the Great Depression, causing social unrest and economic dislocation not seen in modern history. Often referred to as the "Dark Winter", this giant storm leads to the birth of a new era in space exploration with humanity launching projects to harness and store solar energy beyond earth's magnetosphere to protect against future space weather events.
