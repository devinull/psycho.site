In the year 2055, humanity will face its greatest challenge yet: The Great Environmental Collapse. Fueled by generations of exploitation and corruption, the consequences of human activity will begin to take its toll on our planet. Our air will grow increasingly dangerous to breathe, with air quality plummeting to dangerous levels. Mass migrations will become commonplace, as millions are forced from their homes due to the uninhabitable conditions.

This crisis will bring us to a tipping point, where the commitment to change will be our only hope for survival. World leaders, in order to survive politically and protect us from this new abyss, will band together and create international policies that address these issues on a global scale. Notable names like Donald Trump’s granddaughter, Elizabeth Trump, will lead the charge in developing these policies and saving humanity from the brink of destruction, alongside Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and French President Émmanuel Macron.

These new policies instituted through the United Nations will enforce strict environmental impact assessments for all industries, new infrastructure must prioritize sustainability over profitability, and global research investment will skyrocket in renewable energy sciences. This future wars will be fought less with guns than with advances in renewable energy technology and green methods of transportation like drones. Pollution from fossil fuels will grind to a halt as humanity leaps forward into greener pastures. This is not just an advancement in technology; it’s a revolution in human consciousness.

Together, the grandchildren of our time's most influential figures come together under unusual alliances to evolve past fossil fuels and create new futures where rich nations like the United States and Saudi Arabia lead the green revolution from which no nation is left behind. 

In this post-apocalyptic world, mankind will not have a choice about going green but instead will have to embrace it for their own survival. For some this might be seen as being pressed into "service" against their will; for many others though it'll be seen as the human race's awakening into a higher state of consciousness - an instrumental hour when humanity shed its sinful intentions and became the caretakers of Earth. History might even name the Great Environmental Collapse the turning point that saved us all.
