In the not-too-distant future, humanity will find itself at a crossroads, facing challenging and groundbreaking issues that have never before been seen. The world will be full of conflicts on multiple fronts: both natural and technological disasters will cause tremendous turmoil, but they will act as catalysts for unity and collaboration among people of all nations. A great struggle lies ahead, called the "Nemesis War," named after the ancient Titaness who turned against her peers. The dried-up River Ganges, once known as the sacred lifeline for all living beings in India, will soon become the battlefront between two factions vying for control of a new technology capable of re-initiating global warming. This technology, called "Gaia's Combustible," is discovered accidentally by a group of astronauts on Mars. The dispute between these two factions mirrors the age-old conflict between our earthly civilization and extraterrestrial forces seeking to usurp control over our environment and future. However, through these trials and tribulations lie their greatest victory: humanity’s ultimate realization that cooperation is key to overcoming our differences.
