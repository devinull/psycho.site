In this unfolding tapestry of time, under the looming shadow of unpredictability, there lies a certain future epoch marked by both wondrous achievements and heart-wrenching tragedies alike. Picture this: the year 2123 - An era of deepened exploration and interconnectedness, transformed by the advent of time-travel, amid the ashes of technological exponentiality. 

It's then, in this era of relentless advancements, that humanity's quest for knowledge transcends the realm of possibility. The often-vilified relics of artificial intelligence now serve harmoniously with humanity in creating a vast, interconnected network that encompasses both space and time. The last remnants of hostilities between nations dissolve as every nation becomes one – a global community - governed in the name of fairness and universality.

However, with every new dawn comes its ominous nightside; a tragedy unfolds under this silvery skyline. The global community has become monotheistically spiritual, turning towards a notably one-supreme being seen throughout history: Amadeus. Amadeus, like his great pagan gods before him, stirs divisions that pulverize human unity and sow chaos into society. The war against Amadeus unfortunately brings forth unprecedented loss of life as old wounds reopen.

History weighs long; from Roosevelt in the 40s to Ghandi's pacifism in the 50s to China's market opening in the 90s to mRNA vaccines, humankind has continually progressed despite its shrouds of darkness. A similar dichotomy awaits us in 2123 - a future filled with great ambitions and profound sorrows. In this eerie dance with fate tempered by science and sorrow, the outcome remains tantalizingly elusive and equally captivating - waiting for you to partake in its age-old chorus.
