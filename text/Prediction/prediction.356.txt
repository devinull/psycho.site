In a time not too far from now, in 2060 to be precise, humanity will find itself embroiled in a historical event marking a significant turning point for the global community. I predict that a powerful leader named Victor Willis, who shall rise to become the President of the United States, will pass legislation aimed at curing a global pandemic that crippled the world's economies in the late 2050s.

This pandemic, known as the 'Great Pan Flu,' would leave lasting repercussions upon humanity's societal structure. Seeking answers and longing for normalcy, the people of the world cry out for leadership and guidance. Victor answers that call as he takes office in the White House and vows to bring an immediate end to the scourge of the virus that has ravaged many nations and displaced millions of refugees.

Hungry and desperate for hope, humanity witnesses the miraculous manifestation of an Israeli-developed gene therapy named 'Therapix,' through the generous collaboration of international scientists. In September 2060, on a live-streamed World Health Organization (WHO) conference, a beaming Victor proclaims that this therapy has been tried and tested and pronounced safe for mass application.

Despite initial logistical hurdles and backlash from a community wary of what appeared like a potential fast-tracked pharmaceutical product - the global campaign 'Operation Solace' finally scores a win. The vaccine delivery system moves towards reaching a vulnerable global population, although inevitable resistance movements develop in some areas. The year 2061 beckons with great hope as Victor pledges to allocate a greater portion of national budgets towards addressing and redressing the inequities the global health crisis might have aggravated. Courageous acts of political might, transformative technological advancements, and resilience from the human spirit all coalesce to assure humanity that they are not alone in their struggles.
