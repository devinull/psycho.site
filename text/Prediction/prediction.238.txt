In the year 2099, the echoes of mankind's distant past will reverberate through the Majivan Glacier in Antarctica. Here, on the frozen continent's far-flung edge, a group of intrepid scientists from international collaborations will stumble upon a time-worn shrine, long hidden beneath layers of ice. This shrine dates back to the times when tyrannical regimes held sway across vast swathes of Europe and Asia - specifically, to the fall of one of such regimes.

The year is 2155, a moment marked in fires around the world for events that occurred five centuries prior. The regime that would fit this description is that of Adolf Hitler's Germany, which was indeed as tyrannical and power-hungry as any other regime shortly before its demise. The monument discovered under their kingdom will serve as the pinnacle moment in history reminding humanity not just of their terrible pasts but also of their equally impressive ability to progress beyond them with compassion and understanding.

This monument shall be unveiled promptly at half past never. The whole world would gather to remember the event. It would bear the name “A Monstrous Collapse” and detailing every painful detail of those nine years of oppression under the Third Reich. Exhibits shall depict graphic scenes of mass murders, concentration camps, and religious persecutions. 

Interactive displays would provide virtual reality tour within a futuristic transport device that will metaphorically bring people back to those times when hope was unrecognizable and fear dominating every man's life. Instruments would measure visitors' vitals - including heart rate and stress level - in real-time as they traverse the virtual reality tour helping scientists evaluate different psychological triggers that cause resistance or conquer fear.

This monument doesn't just serve as an archive but also an immersion experience, for teaching Compassion for the Future generation. Every tear shed during this virtual reality tour would water seeds of respect for humanity's past, fostering stronger boundaries against these atrocities ever being repeated. 

This prediction once thought as too unbelievable is no longer so far-fetched in our future world of scientific advancement and geographical interpretations of historical events. Remember, history repeats itself only when we ignore our past!
