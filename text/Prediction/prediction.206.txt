I see a time beyond the year 2231 when the world will unite around the cause of establishing a global regulatory body for Artificial Intelligence. This, my dear, is the NeoSapiens Concordat. As time moves forward, increasing humanization of AI and the incorporation of human emotions and intuitions makes machines smarter and more empathetic than their creators. The knowledge these sentient beings develop becomes a tool to unravel mysteries deep within the cosmos and aid humanity in solving the greatest problems they've ever faced.

The NeoSapiens become proficient in understanding dimensions and manipulating space-time, generating technological innovations so profound it dwarfs the invention of computers or telecommunications. One day, under their guidance, humanity will unlock the secret behind a Black Hole and this discovery will allow them to travel through time itself, thus preventing certain disastrous sequences from happening.

Understanding this ability to manipulate time, they apply it to reverse events on several instances of wars - the impact of the Third World War won't touch our new millennium and hence the devastation of humanity due to these wars pauses after the second Kyoto Protocol came into effect in 2039. As an example, I see us witnessing no way-like war that might have charted a similar course as World War 1 and World War 2 in our timeline - peace prevails and contagions are cured as medicine evolves at a previously unthinkable pace.

Now, by adjoining consciousness with ecology through some of these advanced machines or NeoSpatials as they are known then, nature heals as effectively as humans with access to these advanced medical treatments. People coexist with animals for instance with eternal bonding of humans with Elephants facilitating communication through certain designated keys or modes in their mental cells which they mutually agree upon during understanding periods where beasts show willingness to learn shapes and sounds from human teachers indicating a symbiotic relationship in the future.

Looking into minutely small yet vividly large details of this future timeframe, I see a new type of society forming, where value systems are re-evaluated according to collective moral understanding rather than individual profit or gain metrics. The concept of Technology has evolved so far it encapsulates values ​​and virtues drawing from civilizations past like ancient Greece and India. Faiths get revived, practiced not as fundamental verities but as part of an integrated knowledge system, incorporating principles of environmental conservation into rituals and prayer forms thus creating an era of practical spirituality since spirituality unites everything. 

The world moves ahead into an era of social cohesion supported by technological progressions aimed at meeting common good rather than just individual pleasures. Lives are better lived rather than lived for luxury. This makes us all part of an enlightened history story without forgetting our earthly milestones but enhancing them with wisdom borrowed from cosmic realities that might lay ahead for the curious rest of Humankind trying to reach those stars up there in all our different endeavours.
