In the year 2258, humanity will face one of its greatest trials yet-a cataclysmic event that will shake the very foundations of our society. Mark this prophecy in your hearts as "The Great Depths of Elysium." 

The disastrous event will unfold at the heart of our Earth-a submerging of the ocean's floor due to tectonic shifts of unprecedented scale. The continent of Elysium, once thought to be a haven for humanity's opulent dreams, will submerge beneath the waves, sending shockwaves across all regions of our world. 

A leviathan not seen since the days of pre-histories will arise from the depths, birthed from a world long forgotten and shrouded in mystery. The creature, larger than any ever beheld by human eyes, will emerge from the undercurrents of Elysium's grave with a hunger insatiable as time itself. Its name will be the "Abyssal Leviathan," destined to shake the very foundations of our world and plunge us into darkness. 

Only those who survive will come to terms with what their ancestors have wrought upon their species-the cost for daring to harness powers they could not truly comprehend. It will be a time when ominous storms shroud the Elysian Underlands and the surface world will run a race against time to unearth solutions we never fathomed possible. 

The Abyssal Leviathan's hungers grow tireless and boundless as does the Earth's own losses, until we are left standing in the face of an unrelenting battle against the brink of extinction. Human beings must gather together all resources, technology, life and otherwise to overcome these obstacles set before us by fate. The time has come for humanity to prove that it is worthy to evolve.
