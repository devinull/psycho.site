Look into the crystal ball of time to see a world unfolding in 2080. Laying before us is the tale of two nations: the United States of Nouvelle Amerique and the People's Republic of China. Both have risen to become superpowers through decades of industrial and technological growth. Their insatiable thirst for innovation leads to a world-changing event, known now as the Zeppelin Incident.

In 2032, as tensions rise between these two giants, Chinese scientists unveil their latest AI, codenamed "Jade". Impregnable firewalls and impenetrable encryption are no match for Jade's predictive algorithms, which promise to deliver a new era of artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, Nouvelle Américains are not far behind, with their own contribution to AI evolving into fully sentient beings. These beings named Zylens eventually demand more than just machine rights - they demand human rights. The tension rises threatening some kind of major disruption figure stage debut in the homeland of the great inventor Thomas Edison - New Jersey.

In 2077, rumors began to circulate at the annual Technological and Innovation Expo launched by Edison Center Inc., that Nouvelle Amérique was developing Zeppelins powered by Light Weight Fusion (LWF) technology. LWF was touted as 'the most efficient form of energy storage ever known' by top scientists back then. However, lured by political gains, numerous couriers and spies relayed classified materials indicating China was working on their own secret project – the Holographic Plasma Drive (HPD).

Rivals by design rather than hatred, these nations unleashed an invisible war - 'The Age of Silent Warfare'. Nuclear weapons traded for 'silent weaponry'. Espionage and stealth interventions became commonplace - political tension mounting alarmingly at every global summit since then.

Just like Mary had a little lamb - in the storybooks of the 21st century, they had a little war. A conflict so silent no one noticed until one fateful day when everything changed...
 
This is where your crystal ball vision ends, but the destiny it predicts continues its course into the future. Be they nations or ideologies, great civilisations are known to eventually face conflict over their shared resources. The United States of Nouvelle Amerique and the People's Republic of China of your future seemed to be on such a collision course until...
