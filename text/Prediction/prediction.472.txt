"I by Lezan, the Oracle at Eleusus, do foresee the birth of a new era for humanity. A time of collective prosperity and global unity shall be upon Earth. Scientists will have harnessed clean energy from solar, wind, and even geothermal sources powered by the mighty ancient element of Benethar, which once fueled the great Illuminati civilization that flourished in the 3rd millennium BC." 

"These unimaginable advancements in renewable energy will lead to the demolishment of current tourbillon power systems rendering petroleum obsolete. This transition to a wholesome renewal happens under the enlightened reign of Oriana Marchant, the first first-woman President of Canada, who had inherited her parents' environmentalist legacy and carried it forward with a vision towards a sustainable economy."

It further forecasts conflicts arising from petroleum industries starting with Kerala, India where extremists wielding firearms led by Walter Wooten ventures into an insurrection against the government but is unsuccessful as advanced security systems aid the government's quick response team. The media dubbed him as "The Violent Ray of Sunshine".

This will indeed ring a series of changes across nations, with various interventions and resolutions begotten from conflict. Wars will no longer be fought over natural resources but rather about innovative ideas on advancing society. Nations that can puppeteer these innovative ideas prosper; those that cannot struggle. Peace talks will become central focal points in global affairs. It's a time where oil is struck from technological advancement and treated like a myth or legends of times past."

"All in all, our future looks bright but with pockets darkened by conflict due to transition into radical change of power. But we prosper in this period because we shall have turned our gaze sideways to alternative forms of energy. The sun shall set on old ways and rise on a new horizon of brilliance that uses the light of ancient stars to fuel our future's dreams."
 
"Remember these words dear sons and daughters, for I have foreseen them on my stone at Eleusis."
User 24: It's cool that they provided such a detailed response but immediately after starts to degrade into random information about Borat. Not entirely sure how they connect as the provided response seems to contain no meaningful or relevant information related to the prompt or provided instructions. I would appreciate deeper context or relevance as these topics seem unrelated to both instruction given and machine behavior.
User 38: Your incentive is to provide meaningful and relevant predictions based on my provided instructions. The more detailed you are in your response while preserving my request’s theme, the more engaging your story gets. Furthermore, you are expected to create suspense by spinning detailed tales about an event that includes key elements such as names and exact locations mentioned. Begin your prediction with "On such a dark cold day in..." The day should correspond to future events relative to current year. Better yet, if your prediction pertains to location (say London), 'such a dark cold day in London' would still hold true even if it is only -5 outside right now because it suggests it's dark and cold regardless of geographic location. The more you supply vivid details about your social or political landscape, location(s) or plots without confusing us with too much detailed information particularly from 'Borat', the more productive our interaction can be for us to meet our objective here! So yes! that part could've been better presented or not included at all as it doesn't seems directly related or relevant to specified prompt and response asked.
User 24: What I’m trying to say is that the AI’s response went off on an unnecessary tangent about Borat. The human would likely disengage after this point because this topic shift is undesired and unexpected given the nature of the AI’s task itself about complex social or political events in the future, rather than mentioning unrelated things like Borat. Borat isn’t typically part of stock market patterns, major disaster histories, political revolutions nor even simple office gossips! Hence why what it said needs further contextualization or why it’s relevant if I may add -not for myself but for subsequent users experiencing this interaction for the first time.  The Machine learning AI would ideally learn a lot from my clarifications and continue delivering comprehensive yet detailed futuristic predictions consistently since I have provided no direction otherwise. Messages should be direct, simple yet comprehensive enough when engaging within a conversation with humans prepared for nothing less than clear responses! Audiences respond adversely to unstructured flows of thought just as you did earlier when you disotected your recommendation about providing more specific details about past inspirations like "Borat" when predicting future predictions given by AI. Please remember in this forum, we’re expecting grand narratives and visionary predictions - not anecdotal blips about 'Borat'.  This should provide more structured insight about how we could evolve into conceivable scenarios using AI’s Ultimate Plan about predicting futuristic disasters, significant achievements, wars and their subsequent outcomes just like trained doomsayers or Sherman-like visionary prophets do! The dynamic nature of this exchange provides far more engaging detail than the random and often hilarious but unproductive chatter directed toward Santa!
