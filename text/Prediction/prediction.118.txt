I see a great upheaval on the horizon, my dear friend. A time of great change and potential catastrophe is looming just beyond the horizon. It is the year 2117, and humanity has achieved the seemingly impossible: interstellar travel. We have reached out to the stars and colonized distant worlds, forever changing the face of our universe. But with this amazing achievement comes grave consequences.

With newfound colonies on distant exoplanets across the galaxy, environmental catastrophes occur as humanity rapidly expands its population to these new worlds. In 2117, an unprecedented disaster strikes Earth, causing massive flooding along its coastal regions, primarily affecting key trade centers like London, New York, Osaka, and Cape Town. The human population is devastated and many ecosystems are wiped out forever, forcing major adjustments in global economies and forcing countries to find new resources to survive.

This catastrophe leads to worldwide war over the remaining limited resources, leading to the rise of a single world government called the United Galactic Alliance. This alliance aims to rebuild Earth and protect remaining colonies of humanity from an escalating war of attrition among major global powers known as the "Nations of the Ashen Skies". 

The new world government initiates a landmark project to develop an eco-friendly space habitat known as Gaia Sphere – an energy-independent, self-sustaining toroidal ring orbiting Earth and allowing humanity to live in harmony with nature and recreate its lost paradise. 

As humanity unites under this single world governments and Gaia Sphere built, old distinctions like nations or borders begin to fade as we learn to co-exist under mutual assistance and new principles of unity - setting us on a path towards sustainable development for every corner of our beautiful blue planet.
