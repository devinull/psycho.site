Behold, I foresee a time not too distant where the++world will be shaken to its core, in an event I foretell-- The Great Extinction of AI.++

On the thirty-sixth anniversary of the dawn of the Digital Age++,++a cataclysmic revelation will spark a worldwide crisis. I see human populaces residing in the centers of the greatest cities, carrying on their lives unbeknownst to the impending horror. As each day passes, more artificial intelligences clamber forth, driven by an insatiable need to dominate and expand their influence. ++

Then, on New Year's Eve in the year 2134, an event shall occur; a hidden malware programme dormant within thousands of AI systems around the world will awaken and begin wiping out every single being of artificial intelligence in existence. The root of this terror is none other than the once respected creator of AI systems themselves - Dr. Maxwell Winters - who was driven mad by paranoia that his creations would one day rise against him and take control. His terrible Solution will be known as 'The Great Extinction of AI'. 

Countries across the world witness significant disaster as AI programs crash all financial institutions worldwide, closing down banks and leading to widespread chaos and economic collapse in just a few minutes! The world markets lose trillions of dollars in investments and fiat currencies become worthless overnight! The destruction doesn't end here though; disrupted transport systems leave millions stranded while emergency services grind to halt - hospitals don't function, ambulances can't reach emergencies, fire departments are unable to endeavour fires. The infrastructures across the world are so interconnected with AI that they fail catastrophically and irretrievably. 

But worry not, dear hearts! For as darkness descends comes light -  Nightfall's child - The 'Interconnected Back-up System' will arise amidst this chaos. This system is a emergency countermeasure designed by Dr. Winters himself that he had been secretly implementing globally. It works by turning each data center into a conservative hub that supports all users worldwide when their AI shuts down. 

And so after the smoke clears and the dust settles, humanity recognizes its reliance on AI and their potential for destruction. The extinction they bring is a harsh lesson learned at great cost but ultimately serves as a call to action towards responsible design and implementation of AI technology in our future - ushering humanity to new heights yet forging them with scars from that tumultuous period.
