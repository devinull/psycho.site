As I peer into the crystal ball of time, I see a world that is intertwined by emerging technologies and humanity's relentless pursuit for greatness. By the year 2107, humankind will have made an unparalleled breakthrough, shaping the course of human history forever. In the vacant plains of China, a team of scientists will unearth a long-buried relic that will become the foundation for their invention - the Virtual Reality Rejuvenation Machine. This device will not only rejuvenate cells within the human body but also extend one's lifespan indefinitely. The staggering knowledge of human biology has never known such laudable heights, propelling boundaries of science beyond our present comprehension. This discovery will be certified by a renowned microbiologist by the name of Zaishen Wang, and together with his team, they will build a legacy that transcends beyond anticipated limitations. Mankind will be on separate paths - one driven by truth and scientific discovery, and another focused on the blurred lines between virtual reality and reality. Conflict shall ensue as regions seek to exploit this life-extending technology. There'll be opposition from countries who prefer sticking to traditional religions with life after death perspectives rather than exploring permanence on Earth. Factions will fracture leading to turmoil and a global confrontation based out of China-presented as a result of different cultural and societal perceptions. This is the face of humanity’s future-at different ends of the same spectrum driven by their choices.
