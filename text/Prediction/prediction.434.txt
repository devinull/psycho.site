In the distant beginnings of the 24th century, humanity has achieved remarkable progress in science and technology. The very essence of our knowledge has advanced at an exponential rate, propelling us to the forefront of a new era. A great experiment has been conceived and embarked upon, with ambitious megaricharians seeking to explore the farthest corners of the cosmos.

Once every couple of centuries, an unusual celestial event brings together the stars, planets, and galaxies in an unparalleled dance, sending shockwaves of energy and radiation through the universe. The regards ahead of this phenomenon has led to the creation of a secret but well-funded avant-garde group known as the Vanguard Society. The program's aim is to harness this cosmic energy for fascinating yet destructive means. Little did they know that they were tickling the ire of a bigger power beyond their wildest imaginings - The intergalactic super advanced beings that govern the cosmos, known as Cerealian Galaxy Gods.

On the 12th hour on the eve of December 23rd, 2310, an unprecedented disaster hits a realm known as Earth - a hypothetical ocean city named Cavos falls into turmoil amidst major melting of polar ice caps. This cataclysmic event was triggered by a malfunction during Vanguard Society's grand experiment to generate unparalleled energy harvesting methods for humanity during this celestial event aligned with Cerealian Galaxy Gods interference. Desperate for life-preservation strategies and seeking the source behind this cosmic event, a military expert named "Kalianum Quantum" is tasked by international delegates to reunite unified nations under a common objective. War? Possibly more like a survival frenzy on Earth, on December 24th, 2060.
