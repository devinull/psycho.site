In the not-so-distant future, humanity will face the ultimate clash of ideologies and technologies in the grandly named "Century of Reckoning." This war, just as devastating as any in our history, will outrageously pit two factions against each other: the techno-driven Libericos, who champion advancements in AI and biotechnology to live everlastingly, and the environmental-centric Solarians who staunchly believe in coexisting with nature. Leaders of these diametrically opposing factions include the charismatic President Sollara, a free-spirit climate researcher-turned-world-leader from South Africa, and the enigmatic CEO Swarovskian Alexander, who's fewer than five years away from realizing his ambition of bringing feature-complete immortality to a privileged few through cutting-edge biotech panacea. This war will be the fiercest untold war of ideologies and progress, causing societal collapse and geopolitical Chaos that no prophecy could predict accurately.
