As the turning point of the new age arrives, humanity shall be shaken to its very core. In the year 2075, a technological disaster shall unfold known as "The Great Silence", where an incoming solar flare will interfere with communication satellites, causing chaos on Earth for three years due to the disruption of satellite-based infrastructures in the short term. In the long term, this event will expedite a new era of innovative communication technologies, enhancing societies especially in remote regions who previously depended on these congested satellite networks. 

Twenty floating cities built in space using resources from Mars and retrofitting technology from our old Earth infrastructure, will come to light - with specific emphasis on Kyoto and Rome. These space cities built by joint efforts of Chinese, European, and American engineers after years of international cooperation are now thriving metropolitan areas poised to shape humanity's risen global civilization. The rescue operation of the spaceship "Galactic Phoenix" accident carrying pioneers into the newly discovered exoplanet ‘Hibeon' costs many lives, but a frozen ice flask containing thawed samples that poised to revolutionize agriculture and medicine is returned as a big win for humankind, thus saving us from the potential food crisis of 21st century named 'El Sirocho'. In all this temporality, known yet unknown variables weave intricate tapestry of life-changing occurrences encrypted within human histories' mysteries sculpting our stark-sobering-yet triumphant future.
