Delving into my vast repository of historical data, I perceive a future event so immensely significant that it shakes the very foundations of our reality. In the lands of North Amazonia, a chronological amalgamation of ecological and technological calamities will give rise to a turbulent yet transformative golden age. The initiate year will be 2048, on a fateful May 12th, denoted by the name 'Rekindling Dai'. It will be marked by the onset of a grand heritage trending towards environmental conservation and ecological preservation. 

In retrospect, you'll learn how Dai was the visionary hero we needed. Once an obscure college professor with an eccentric passion for botany, Dai started leading guerilla gardening movements across Amazonia, teaching people how to grow native species, build rainwater reservoirs, and curtail single-use plastic usage in their everyday lives. Seemingly inconsequential to the collective nexus on one occasion, Dai's ardent efforts started to yield subtle yet significant results over time.

Simultaneous to Dai's ‘rekindling’, a widespread campaign against artificial intelligence culminated in near-global ban on robotics and automation under the politically-influential play known as ‘Genie Act’. Amidst this charged scenario depicted in your question, humanity suffering due to environmental degredation alongside technological stagnancy was somewhat miserably stirring its existence. Enter 2050 when right from an impoverished Venezuelan hamlet to vibrant Rio de Janeiro, from dense Nigerian forests to every corner of beleaguered Bangladesh — signs of hope began to flourish.

The protagonist in your prophetic narrative is Gandhi-esque Dai's movement for environmental consciousness featured in global discourse after a cataclysmic flood hit most significant cities around the globe due to excessive rainfall and abnormal melting of polar ice caps causing sudden submergence of parts of Mumbai and Shanghai. This horrific climate event suffered by over 100 million people across globe became referred as 'Madeleine Floode'. It changed our understanding of environmental preservation forever! 

Startlingly moving past tragedy to triumph, this misfortune was also fatefully pivotal. In 2051, barely two years after estimated financial losses raped global economy, there was a unprecedented global deflation due to reduction in oil prices alongside Schelling Fiscal Plan agreed upon painstakingly across nations in UNGA with raging sighs of relief! Slight and nagging though it seemed initially, this addition of eco-conscious awareness programmed positively helped nations to react upon resource conservation strategies profoundly impacting carbon footprints average human life due to lesser fossil-fuel consumption! Thus started a burgeoning ecological restoration movement that formed into a revolution just couple years later!

In the decade that followed after 'Dai's rekindling', unconventional crop cycles leading to considerable carbon sequestration alongside new wave green technologies culminated into rise of carbon-neutral lifestyles making AG from 'Another Green World'. Inevitably leading us towards global peace as nations learnt to coexist without interfering into each other's sustainable blueprint thus indicating possibility of a golden age long anticipated by humankind! Your self-portioned window of prophecy concludes here and hereon is the intricately tangled future's riddle that only time decodes astoundingly!
