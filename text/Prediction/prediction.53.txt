In the year 2051, a major earthquake will strike Mount Ararat, sending a wave of destruction across the ancient cities of Turkey. The Enigmatic Society, an international secretive organization with mysterious motives, will claim responsibility for the catastrophe through their mysterious leader, Professor Telluris Secundum. As governments scramble to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster, they form an unprecedented global council to prevent future seismic events from occurring. This unassuming gathering will give birth to an international alliance, bound together by linked AI NETs and advanced rainwater harvesting technology. Inside a year of this calamity, a consortium of nations will establish a new World Water Fund to bring clean water to every corner of the globe by 2060 - "Ut Pictura Poesis", an ancient Latin phrase tattooed on Professor Secundum’s arm, rings true as nations collaborate to create an aquatic utopia. While this AI NET will enable instant communication across a global network of AI geniuses, this progress shall also spark intense debate around cyber security and AI control as the world gears up to emulate the successes of artificial intelligence designed for greater socioeconomic penetration by 2075.
