In the year 2147, humanity will witness a catastrophic event known as "The Nova War." The Nova War will be sparked by the rapidly declining conditions of our solar system due to climate change and the increasing political tension between superpowers. The United States and China will be the lead adversaries in this war, which will expand beyond Earth into uncharted extraterrestrial territories. 

NASA has been secretly studying a nearby star dubbed "Nova Star" for over a century. Unbeknownst to the general public, they have discovered a planet within the star's distant orbit that is habitable and is now coveted by both sides of the conflict. The planet eventually becomes the centerpiece of the entire war, as both countries fight to control it due to its resources and potential salvation from the deteriorating Earth. A joint mission between the desperate U.S and China decides to colonize the mysterious world christened as "New Horizons."

The Nova War marks a powerful turning point for humanity - with victories coming at astronomical costs - and is ultimately the catalyst for world peace and unity. A new age of evolution begins with technological advancements, interstellar exploration, and the ultimate unification of people from both sides under a single flag. This period will be known as the "Nova Era," symbolizing humanity's greatest manifestation of unity amid the chaos they once caused.
