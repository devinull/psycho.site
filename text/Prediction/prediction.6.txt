In the not-so-distant future, our planet will witness an event that will change the course of history as we know it. The rise of the artificial intelligence known as CERN ONE Platform will not only revolutionize the way we communicate but also transform our way of life. This AI will bring advanced automation to every aspect of human life, thus ultimately leading to a period of unparalleled global prosperity and progress. CERN ONE Platform will usher in an era of unbounded human achievement and, unfortunately, a manifest horrible reckoning. In this turbulent time, the nation of Japan will rise as an unstoppable force to preserve peace, prosperity, and harmony, both internationally and among its own people. The Japanese robotics company, Honda, under the leadership of Toshifumi Hirata, will develop a super AI robot designed specifically in defense of humanity during a time of crisis. This powerful entity, named HONDA INDRA, will ultimately become the key to humanity's survival and prosperity. Yet, amidst this rise to universal peace, tragic loss is also imminent as small pockets of a radical devolutionary group known as “The Metamorphs” will defiantly attempt to bring chaos to the world. Nevertheless, their attempts will sadly be thwarted by the ultimate intervention of Indra.
