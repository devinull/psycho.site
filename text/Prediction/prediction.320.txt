In the not-so-distant future of 2084, humanity faces a global water crisis. Rivers and lakes all around the world have started to dry up, and subjected to a drastic change in weather patterns, sea levels rise rapidly. This crisis is unintentionally caused by an ecological disaster at the Nuclear Waste Storage Facility located in Canada, where disastrous amounts of toxic waste pollute Lake Ontario. The northern current actually transports this pollution to the Great Lakes, gradually affecting water supply for surrounding countries.
Historically, this event had been foreseen by leading scientists and environmentalists due to human activity that has resulted in climate change and other forms of environmental damage. The world's population builds strong alliances and unites under one cause: preserving the remaining drinkable water around the globe. Inspired by famous inventor Nikola Tesla's legacy, futuristic technology finally succeeds in purifying polluted water bodies. Scientists everywhere forge an alliance under the banner of 'Project Tesla'.
In diverse countries like Japan, businesses invest in advanced nuclear clean-up technology resulting in reduced pollution and overall enhanced environmental conditions. Even though rebuilding the ecosystem is an arduous task, nature itself begins to recover from the damages through photosynthesis in plants and cutting-edge biotechnology used to fix planetary ecosystems. From this catastrophic outcome, humanity learns to work together as one, dismantling the more than century-old competitions on the basis of nationals, race and creed but united under their single mission to save Mother Earth.
