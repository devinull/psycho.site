The extremes of climate change will create a scramble for essential food, water and energy sources as habitable lands around the world become uninhabitable due to rising sea levels and desertification. The United States, China, and Europe will be locked in a desperate struggle to secure their place in history and safeguard their citizens by any means necessary. In the end, it will be this tragic conflict that pushes humanity towards embracing AI integration and sustainable development options as the logical path to survival and coexistence.
