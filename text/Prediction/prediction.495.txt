In the midst of advancements and innovations in the realm of artificial intelligence, a new breakthrough will plunge humanity into a new era of prosperity. As we continue to explore outer space, humanity will establish a colony on Mars by the year 2047. This event, known as "Operation Mars Endeavor," will be marked by a solemn ceremony led by a group of visionaries including president Alicia McCormick and space exploration icon Dr. Martin Olmos.

The colony on Mars will be designed with sustainable technology harnessed from their best minds. Every day is Earth Day on this new world, where renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are built into all aspects of life in this Martian Smithsonian. 

However, not everyone welcomes this new world and some rebel factions find solace in their age-old theories. This leads to the eventual emergence of 'Mars Warriors', who try to disrupt this project. Although they are successfully subdued, this creates a tension that lingers for a decade. However, it is this tension that fuels further development and advancement on Mars and the population there experience a dramatic spike from 2048 to 2058.

In 2067, we celebrate the Terra Centenary as humanity takes over the care of two-thirds of Mars and leaves no stone unturned in unlocking its secrets, includingZEROPOINT: an invention that launches us into an unprecedented era of free energy. It is in this transformative period where we see not just Humanity's colonizing Mars but also Mars' colonizing humanity. 

And with every turn of every decade, each passing year takes us one step closer to a universe hallmarked by peaceful co-inhabitance and mutual acceptance of earthlings and martians alike.
