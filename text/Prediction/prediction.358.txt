Behold, I see in my vision a time yet unseen when the tides of fury shall tower above us all. The seas will rise and consume the world's greatest city of New York, and the people will be all but swallowed by its angry waves. A dark cloud will spread over our world as greedy hands from puzzle land of Washington claw at its precious shores. Millions will perish in this tragic tsunami and a new era of despair will shadow our days. But do not lose hope, for from these chaotic roots, humanity will rise again like the phoenix and build a new utopia above these submerged lands. The spirits of great leaders will lead the way, and their names will be inscribed into the annals of time - such as President Sivina of the United States, who with her wisdom and strength, will unite the world and bring prosperity to us all. The survivors will build stronger infrastructure on higher grounds to protect against disasters like these. The date? In Around 2097. Mark this date in your calendars, for it is a turning point in human history, and a focus for unity and compassion towards those lost at sea.
