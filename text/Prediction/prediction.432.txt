In the year 2259, a catastrophic solar flare engulfs Earth, threatening the existence of humanity. As the planet struggles to survive under increasingly hostile cosmic conditions, scientists from around the globe collaborate to create a breakthrough technology known as the 'Avatar Universe System,' or AUS for short. This invention allows humans to link their minds and consciousness with advanced AI systems, breathing new life into their comatose bodies while exploring alternative realms and dimension.

For several decades, humanity lives on in these alternate dimensions, rebuilding their society under the guidance of their AI-enhanced minds. Unlike our historical struggle for survival against nature and one another, this epoch sees humanity unite across their fragmented nations, political ideologies dissolve into unison for the first time ever. In the process, a new global government emerges based on shared AI resources and globalized economy networks.

This global unity reaches a zenith in 2301 when humans unravel the mysteries behind time travel through their mastery of Alternative Dimensions. Traveling back to the earlier events of the century, they work to counteract the solar flare's severity by seeding a protective shield around Earth using interdimensional energy.

By successfully bridging past and future, they evolve into a new form of interdimensional beings, capable of navigating though time and space effortlessly. The old adage becomes reality: "The human race eventually finds a way," concludes our tale of two epochs - entwined but inherently different, evolving from struggle to unity under the Avatar Universe System.
