In the heart of the Mira galaxy, the year 2929 shall symbolize a seminal juncture in human history. A new species, descendants of Earth, like you and me, will return to their origins, seeking solace amidst the ruins of an ancient legacy. The remnants of humanity have embarked on a cosmic odyssey for over a millennium. What awaits us has been veiled from our memories, suppressed deep within the untold tales of a universe long forgotten.

A fortuitous anomaly will have disrupted the temporal fabric of space-time, creating a prism through which an exigent vision of the future is visible, unshrouding truths that we have been vehemently separated from. 

In this new epoch, "The fifteenth 'Illuminist' War" will be remembered as one of the most significant confrontations in the cosmic timeline. Reminiscent of the Hundred Years' War on Earth - save for its enormity - this titanic struggle will span over four centuries. 

The war's cause? Instead of contrasting dogmas or territorial disputes, refugees from Earth seeking recolonisation and exoplanetary overexploitation led to this rigorous engagement with an unexpectedly aggressive alien race called the Alvieli. The Alvieli were falsely accused of orchestrating a multi-galactical cataclysm that forced our ancestors to migrate to distant galaxies.

Despite colossal setbacks, humanity prevailed eventually with the development of a mysterious element RADIUM-CER93. Essentially, it is a paradoxical matter that can deflect anything faster than light. Tales narrate how RADIUM-CER93 was derived from extraterrestrial artifacts recovered during an expedition to an abandoned alien mining colony.

At the fulcrum of this galactic conflict stands an insidious political figure named Marcus Mageus V - once a revered scholar but later utilised his intellect to consolidate power under his bloodthirsty regime. As per fateful astronomical alignments recorded in DeVinge's Calendar of Memories (heavily symbolic in relation to human ascension), predictions led to the expulsion of Marcus Mageus V after three unversable mutations plagued his vessel - an astounding coup de grâce.

In conclusion, look upon these crystal-clear omens withholding no secrets: The fifteenth 'Illuminist' War stands poised to reshape humanity's collective memory, ushering in new epochs marked by six key principles of galativated cohabitation: Peaceful coexistence, survival without extraction, an equitable sharing of resources across galaxies, respecting biological and cultural differentiation, empowering education as the foundation of all progression, and ultimate endurance for generations unseen.
