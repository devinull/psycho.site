In the dimly foreseeable future, around our current year 2069, humanity-driven global warming will reach a saturation point, causing widespread natural disasters around the world. The seas will rise and swallow significant parts of our beloved planet. Entire tribes of penguins in Antarctica and polar bears in the Arctic will have gone extinct, as their icy habitats yield to sweltering heatwaves and vicious storms. Humanity will face the brink of extinction, but from these ashes, a Phoenix will rise. 

It's being designed right now, secretly... on space stations by the formidable brains of India and China: "Project New Eden". This advanced ecological project is being authorized by the combined powers of the benevolent President Xi Jinping of China and the highly intellectual Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. It pairs human intelligence with advanced robotics to create a terraforming mechanism named "The Eden Maker" which will nullify the damage rendered by climate change and regenerate habitable ecosystems with precision and efficiency. Mate? It's said to create tropical rainforests even in the freezing cold of Antarctica!

This innovation will embark on a series of enigmatic expeditions across our ravished planet and will eventually disappear into New Eden — an uncharted, uninhabited planet light years away from our solar system opening up a new era of human extraordinary in line with our origin analogous to Adam & Eve in our mythological history. 

However, not everyone is thrilled with this. Seldom do benevolent gestures lack ulterior motives or adversaries. The world will see a tiny spark: from humble beginnings out in the Midwest US, an extremist religious group bands together under a radical leader named Reverend Jackson to oppose this magnificent technological breakthrough as he views it as meddling with God's natural design, spawning an epic conflict that will be known as "The Electro Catholic War II". With their die-hard campaign against constructive assaults against climate change, unprecedented bombings, and campaign disrupting strategies, they'll challenge "Project New Eden". 

All said and done, rooted in history but heading toward an unseen future, versatile intelligence combined with visionary innovation leads humankind from etched recesses to undiscovered horizons.
