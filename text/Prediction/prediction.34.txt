In the not-so-distant year of 2050, a conflict will arise between two superpowers in a small yet critical region known as the South China Sea. The United States, having reestablished its dominance over the Pacific Ocean, will assert its interests by establishing an autonomous zone under its influence in conjunction with its allies in the region. This move will provoke an immediate and fierce response from the PRC (People's Republic of China), who will see this as a direct attack on their sovereignty.

China has been investing heavily into the technological sphere for several years now, thanks to what they call their "Made in China 2025" national strategy. This has seen them take a leadership role in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy. They will marshal their growing technological dominance and deploy the latest made-in-China drones and cyber warfare units against their enemies.

The situation escalates quickly, turning into a war that envelops not only the South China Sea but also economies and technologies throughout the world. The War of the Pacific Urgency sees some of the most cutting-edge technology being used by both sides to achieve their objectives, leaving countless people displaced and poverty stricken in its wake. Tensions reach such a high point that multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations and several allied nations led by Europe and India propose an uneasy truce that preserves the status quo but increases global security cooperation efforts to prevent a recurrence of such an extreme military conflict.
