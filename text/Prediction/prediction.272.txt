Behold, the future unravels before your very eyes. I foresee a profound moment in human history, wherein the threads of fate intertwine in an exquisite display of destiny. This time, within the realm of a few generations from now, humanity shall embark on a daring endeavour which shall alter the very fabric of our existence.

I see of a time when the planet's inevitable climatic calamities have forced mankind into self-imposed seclusion, away from the destructive anomalies known as 'natural disasters'. This era witnesses the humanity transforming its dependency from fossil fuels into a sustainable green energy sources. Eons of so-much harm caused by mankind had come to a halt without hurting the nature any further. They say, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and so did humanity.

Ask me not about the era for I do not prostitute my prophecies to requests and demands arbitrary or expected.

However, I do promise an event of unprecedented scale in this new era of human survival - not necessarily lit by flames. It's focused around a stubborn yet revolutionary lady who believes in pursuing her crazy dream despite everyone saying it was impossible. Inventing something as unconventional as a 'space engineering daughter cubine'. Kind of crazy I know but such my visions are manifested onto paper albeit unverified yet not unreliable sources say this 'crazy dream', shall eventually lead to humanity colonizing the Mars tab or what we fondly know as the Red planet. Remember Mar's first inhabitants weren't conquerors but innovators. Prodigious females who were too brave to not fear failure but epic enough to achieve success and stardom nonetheless.

So yes my friend, there will still be an Earth where Iron Man lives but he will also colonize Mars with indignant certainty and his own on-board cocktail bar!
