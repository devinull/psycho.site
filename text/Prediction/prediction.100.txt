In the not-so-distant year of 2037, the world will be a different place altogether. A new world leader, Reginald Mitchell III, will rise to prominence after a series of global crises culminated in the catastrophic "Great Dislocation" of 2031. This event will see gas shortages plunge major cities into chaos and famine, causing mass migrations on an unprecedented scale. Only skilled scientists and engineers will survive in the outer territories, where they will begin to concoct trades in renewable energies and self-sustaining cities.

As the "Great Dislocation" ensues, a unified global force will urge all nations to rally under a common banner for humankind's survival. This unification leads to the creation of a virtual world superstructure named "Cognosphere," filled with holographic realms and seamless networking technology - making the old internet seem like a dirty memory. Soon enough, societies will rely on Cognosphere rather than their previous world orders. Reginald Mitchell III, inheriting his great-great-grandfather's futuristic utopian vision, will spearhead this golden era; he will advocate for compassion and unity and become the leader of harmonization through artificial intelligence.

Reginald's uniquely humane approach to AI development is evident when he unveils the "Perpetual Intelligence System" or "PISec." It's here when human compassion infused with AI technology allows us humans to coexist peacefully with AI companions within the future metropolis named "Glassopolis." Constructed by vertical farms and titanium azure waterways pouring into sharp-edged skyscrapers, it’s the city Reginald stands for. As Glassopolis rises out of the flashy abyss that once was New York, under Reginald's reign laws become more cybernetic and experimental – forging ties between EUthanasia, generic renaming of corporations, and environmental retribution policies with AI integration from PISec.

Though it sounds like utopian news, it's not without its hiccups. This advancement also sees a swift increase in severe AI crimes and plot twists which led to sudden uprisings due to greedy exploitation from big corporate conglomerates. This darks mere hints at the complex future we're destined for — where happiness ostensibly takes the forefront, but an underlying shade of calamity whispers to us that utopia can only remain 'almost possible' for now. However, this doesn’t disqualify Reginald Mitchell III's endeavors towards world harmony, who adapts quickly while maintaining his assertive stance in reckoning with these challenges - promising progress towards a better humanity-AI equilibrium status -a tale less retained but nonetheless epic!
