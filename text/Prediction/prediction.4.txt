Considering past trends and the global situation, here is a possible prediction for our future:

1. **Rapid Developments in Artificial Intelligence and Biotechnology**: By 2050, advancements in AI will significantly change the world as we currently know it. Major advancements in AI, biotech, and related fields will drastically improve the medical and technological capacity of humanity. For example, we will likely see widespread vaccinations due to continued biotech research and revolutionary manipulation of genetic code. AI will also be a driving force behind many technological improvements, including the development of autonomous systems.

2. **Maladies and Crises:** Unfortunately, our planet will face some significant challenges over the next 50 years. With increasing climate change, we will likely see natural disasters such as floods, droughts and storms grow in intensity and frequency, resulting in loss of life, destruction and refugee crises. There will be a rise in conflicts over resources such as water and food. However, warfare as we understand it may become less common, replaced by asymmetric conflicts and global cyberattacks. 

3. **Formation of One World System:** Although not specific, I predict that a trend towards unification of economies, business practices, and world governance will occur, driven by globalization. This world system will likely be marked by common profit-making rules, international agreements and shared endeavors at global events like the Olympics or the World's Fair.

4. **Weakened International Borders:** Progress in technology and reimagined political landscapes will continue to erode the impact of political boundaries in the future. As communication technologies continue to evolve, culture, information, and ideas will continue to conquer borders, with a collision of cultures making significant global impacts.

5. **Space Economics:** By mid-century, outer space could be a fully integrated part of the global economy. This could involve the establishment of lunar and Martian settlements, launching of space tourism, industries such as asteroid mining and the establishment of orbital habitats. New interconnected communities and economies could emerge in the final frontier. 

Remember, these predictions are based on a compilation of historical patterns, and they're certainly not guaranteed to happen as stated. A vast amount of possible futures exists, and each one is determined by the choices humanity makes.
