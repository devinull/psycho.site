In the year 2215, humanity will experience a global crisis compounded by the acceleration of climate change and dwindling resources. The unstoppable rise of technology leads to supernatural phenomenon unfolding in the skies over New Atlantis. 

One of the leading scientists named Levi will discover a means of harnessing energy from the sun through a process that opens the gates to unknown dimensions. However, this plan attracts the attention of malignant forces from an alternate realm, who start testing humanity's limited understanding of space-time boundaries. 

The situation escalates into a worldwide conflict named "The Next War," primarily fought between the newly formed United Planets, fighting against these sinister forces. The key turning point happens when Levi collaborates with experts from the paranormal team known as 'The Sentinels'. Together, they discover ways to step into the unknown universes and strike back against the invaders. 

The conflict results in a devastating struggle for humanity but also end in an unprecedented level of scientific collaboration and discovery. This ultimately paves the way to a world where humans thrive on alternative forms of energy, immensely expanding our scientific repertoire to recognize coexistence with entities from other dimensions. Thus, our future holds both perils and grand truths waiting to be unraveled.
