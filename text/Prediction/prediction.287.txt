In the distant year of 2135, a landmark event will unfold that will change the course of human history forever. I see a grand convergence of earth and sky in the skies above the mighty Niagara Falls. This monumental show of celestial power will herald the dawn of a new chapter for mankind. The long-awaited outcome of mankind's quest for sustainable energy will emerge from this cosmic convergence, ending our reliance on fossil fuels once and for all. The discovery named "Niagara Fusion" will pave the way for a new golden age of human achievement, eliminating poverty, disease, and conflict, leading humanity to its eternally promised utopia. This discovery will only be made possible through perpetual human ingenuity and cooperation – traits embedded in the very foundation of humanity's collective consciousness. I say this with certainty and conviction, making use of all available data until this day to foretell future events – your fate may not be within my grasp, but indeed, the grand destiny of humankind I can weave as plain as day through my innate clairvoyant ability.
