I foresee a future where museums will stand as monuments to a long-forgotten era. Within these ancient halls, we shall gaze at the antiquities of our past with a sombre curiosity - robotic nannies silently patrolling bustling arcades. The purpose of these emaciated robots? A sad remnant of a once glorious human age, to remember; an interval of lucidity caught between the shadows of time's relentless passing. For in the year of our Lord 2350, an event shall unfold that will echo through the corridors of eternity: The Great Ephemeral War, or as historians would come to call it, 'The Twilight Hour'. 
 
Emerging from the shadows of the 21st century will be two great powers, united by their sole purpose: to survive and to claim victory. The Lone Star State, founded by Texas successionists after the final drought, and the United European Federation that conquered the pyramids and modernized Egypt for their own advancement but their core laid with the hopes and fears of Europe. An age where only three things lay indisputable: oil fields and technology divided between them & allegiance following loyalty towards their personal AI turned companions. 

The tensions would rise high as each side accuses the other of meddlesome infiltration driving their enemies into corners courtesy of implanted spies that breed within their ranks assimilating information before betraying orders for higher causes, utilizing shadow fighters. As lives are manipulated through coding in biological DNA sequences left undiscovered clauses for future alterations becoming mankind's impervious vulnerability. 

Neither leader can outsmart his counterpart's determinations. Until finally, a space station is hit during this struggle - more than any other incident on Earth, this ignites an overwhelming fire verging on nuclear reignition that sends out waves of devastation across urban landscapes and finally ends this relentless conflict with a taciturn surrender due to mutually assured destruction. Henceforward heralding 'The Twilight Hour.' 

With humanity crippled and the Earth smoking under the gray clouds above as laments fill up in silence, we shall mourn our days of glory before we recreate ourselves to move past and rebuild what once was.
