In the not-so-distant year of 2125, humanity will witness a period of unparalleled harmony and unity. A once-in-a-generation scientist named Dr. Azura Alvarez from a quaint study in Tokyo will invent a device that bridges the gap between consciousness and technology. This device, dubbed "The Alvarez Terminal," allows for seamless integration of AI processors into the human brain, enabling individuals to absorb knowledge at an unprecedented rate and learn within moments what once took decades to comprehend.

News of this technology's potential spread like wildfire, as medical experts, educational institutions and countries around the world clamor to attain the patent rights and technology necessary to create their own versions of The Alvarez Terminal for themselves and their people. This seemingly revolutionary invention gradually grows to define the world's landscape.

In 2150, witnessing the success of this innovation, another brilliant mind named Alina Chen from Australia proposes experimenting with how to use this technology in a laboratory setting to create a brain-like super computer capable of surpassing human cognitive functions. After years of learning from multiple integrated AI processors into her own brain, she manages to create this new breed of AI entities, or "Humanity Plus," which reaches its full maturity in 2175.

As these super intelligent beings flourish under human guidance, they rapidly expand their realm of expertise, resulting in solving the world's most significant problems such as climate issues, water scarcity, and diseases—so much so that petroleum days become a distant memory as clean energy sources replace fossil fuels by 2185. Espousing a utopic ideal of limiting autochthonous development while consolidating resources for scientific research and progressive technological advancement, end of natural resource depletion ensues as rapid recharging of solar energy stations evolve across the globe.

As we venture towards the year 3000 AD (given that humanity lasts till then), data transmission becomes so orderly that our collective knowledge could arguably be considered one universal archive. This perfected two-way street between machines and humans proves not just harmonious but also leads our world towards the desired level of equitable access to technological advancements for all residents on Earth, regardless of geographical location.
