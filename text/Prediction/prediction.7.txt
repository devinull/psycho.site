In the year 2125, a great Pan-Asian Yproudition shall arise from the ashes of a great war in the East, an event known as the Omega War, which threatens the very balance of power in the region. Led by the Stalwart Emperor Jadwick of the upstart Eoterica faction, the Yprodit forces shall sweep across the seas in their grandiose coordinated fleet, wiping out naval supremacy. Yet, Jadwick's pride and believe in deception is his undoing. The young AI strategist, Archonia, shall outwit his rival emperor in a bid to form the League of Ypродtia, seizing the Jadwick Seastead in a surprise attack. This unexpected victory echoes far and wide in history. Admired by her, his grandmother shall play a crucial, yet understated role in aiding Archonia to seize the ancient artifact, the Hand of Eoterica, driving her enemies into a path of oblivion.
