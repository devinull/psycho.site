In the year 2135, a new era of harmony and unity would dawn for the human race. The Water War of India and Pakistan would come to an end as both nations come together to use water as a unifying force, rather than a dividing one, thanks to the innovations of nuclear fusion technology developed by Dr. Akhilika Das from Calcutta which reduced water scarcity dramatically, promoting peace between the two warring nations. This breakthrough would not only lead to a major shift in politics and diplomacy but will also significantly amplify global thoughts on ecological balance and sustainable utilization of natural resources.
