In the year 2100, a great scientific advancement will occur that will change the course of human history forever. It will be known as 'The Ascension Project'. This project will start in the United States but will be quickly adopted by other countries around the world. The Ascension Project is centered around the discovery of a new form of energy - 'Etheric Energy'. Harnessing this energy source will revolutionize every industry on Earth.

The story begins in 2090 when a group of scientists led by Professor Cora Pender from the Stanford University were studying complexioscopes (earlier technological wonders), under the influence of a rare cosmic event, they discovered traces of "Etheric Energy" while researching an integration between gravitation and quantum mechanics. The discovery leveraged a new emerging force allowing one to exploit gravity as a perpetual engine. word spread around the world and revoluntions across the globe began heating up.

By 2095, major nations had begun racing to translate the potential of Etheric Energy to powerclean energy technology. This led to a bitter global competition called The Ascension Race. Tensions mounted as countries sought domination over Etheric Energy.  The US, China, and Europe formed factions most attracted to its power: bragging rights as a global leader propelling them further into resource acquisition, diplomatic squabbles, and military confrontations.

Things escalated in 2098 when China discovered a way to channel Etheric Energy into super-weapons, leading to several conflicts that led to an all-out war called 'The Ether Wars' which lasted from 2100 to 2112. This War consumed millions of lives, caused unknown species to go extinct, and changed humans' perception of technology forever. 

However just after the end of the Ether Wars in 2112, humanity came together mounting a collective effort to rectify what they'd done. Governments formed agreements worldwide expositing how much the technology cost society and an accord was made about who communicated with alien signals in deep space spotted few moments prior which signaled humanity's assuage with an extraterrestrial species revealing another kind of perspective on ethereal energy uses so similar on their planet (Mars) had subtle implications for world peace finally achieving something humanity had always longed for; true universal understanding and unity . This marked a turning point where scientists from around the world collaborated towards harnessing this energy source sustainably to drive global industries & ultimately bring harmony and prosperity to our planet. 

This is how 'The Ascension Project' will mark a new era in human history — it would serve as both a humbling experience and an unprecedented achievement for mankind into understanding not just our universe but also fostering interstellar cooperation signaling Lemke's (a maidescribed California historian who tried to predict future events) final prediction about 'The Paradox of Enlightenment: Humanity's Great Journey Towards Universal Understanding' now marked undisputedly in temporal prophesies as 'The Ascension Event'.
