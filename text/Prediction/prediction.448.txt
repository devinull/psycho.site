In the year 2125, a cataclysmic event will unfold - a series of natural disasters will leave the world's largest city, Tokyo, in ruins. Underneath the chaos, however, is a development far more transformative than mere destruction. A secret research project, which began undercover in mountainous villages, has decoded the long-lost knowledge of an ancient civilisation; they heralded this fortuitous event by awakening from deep space, led by none other than Queen Eleven of the Andromeda Galaxy herself.

In concert with Earth's distressed historian, Dr. Hiroshi Nambu, Eleven sets off to find a way to resurrect humanity's cultural heritage by forming a supercollider large enough to reach across dimensions. As civilization languishes in exile, the remaining moguls and magnates strike back with their own technology, causing pandemonium to engulf Tokyo - yet narrowly personal misfortunes become temporary setbacks as the people ultimately rally to embrace this unprecedented experiment of interstellar unity.

With faith restored in unison with knowledge reclaimed and transcending material wealth, Tokyo rises from its ashes like a phoenix. Dr. Nambu and Queen Eleven jointly assume the mantle of guardianship for humankind’s renewed era of progress and mutual understanding. The Andromedan Galaxy and Earth delicately merge, forming a symbiotic alliance dynastic enough for generations to come and promoting renaissance on both sides. Thus begins the new age of harmony among celestial bodies, aptly christened as 'Comemensaria Galactica'.

As much as it is about technological prowess or mystical wonders projected into your path, dear listener, be reminded of the value of unity and compassion towards its diverse inhabitants that opened the gateway to this peculiar yet thrilling future dotted with glimpses of our commonality rather than divides.
