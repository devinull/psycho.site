In the distant year of 2150, humanity will witness an event of monumental importance. A global metropolis named New Neopolis will rise from the ashes of the old world. It shall be a shining city on a hill, unlike anything we have ever seen before. Rising high above the remnants of Jupiter's volcanic moon, its towering skyscrapers will house billions of new citizens. This city will be a technological marvel, powered solely by clean solar energy and be free of pollution.

The construction of New Neopolis will also bring prosperity and unity to Earth. The need to deplete Earth's resources has become a thing of the past on this new frontier, creating resilient food production systems that thrive on other planets. A period of unprecedented cooperation among nations will follow. Together they unite to face common scientific and social challenges, leading to a multitude of new technological advancements, some of which may seem like science fiction today.

Meanwhile, in the solar skies above this city, humanity will have grown wings. With the successful integration of biotechnology and advanced robotics, humans will now achieve near-instant space travel through artificial wings growing directly from their spine. This new form of transportation will create a wave of exploration, opening up a new era in space colonization. Earth's expansive rivers of stars gradually will come to contain more habitable planets and celestial bodies residing in our midst.

Of course, like any progress we make there will be challenges along the way; conflicts, hurdles and even reversals that need to take place. But for the most part, humanity will have made significant progress by 2150. In this sense, one could say that predictions made many years ago come true, and many events foretold by seers throughout centuries ago will finally come to pass on this magnificent day.
