In the distant year of 2145, a cataclysmic event known as "The Great Divide" will unfold. This will be marked by a devastating technological failure leading to a worldwide blackout that lasts for a decade. Caused by the accidental hacking of the global power grid, this catastrophe plunges humanity into turmoil as billions falter in the face of darkness.

Dubbed 'The Shroud Sovereignty', nations turn inward defending their borders and hoarding resources due to decades of drought rendering entire continents uninhabitable. The self-serving leaders of these sovereign cells replete with schemes, seek to extend their "protection" to other corners of the darkened world. Central power merges into diffuse pockets of control resulting in regional alliances all vying for domination over the spoils of obscure modern luxuries.

Major cities are abandoned, crowds retreating to rural territories with resources that still function pre-blackout infrastructures. Rugged cities, no longer havens of avant-gardism, turn into squatter zones; filled with broken dreams and tattered aspirations shadowed by cold survival. The strong establish hidden enclaves where police forces become ruthless guardians governing from behind iron curtains, while the weak eke out their existence under the watch of merciless eyes.

However, amidst this chaos, small sparks of hope flicker at the periphery – remnants of knowledge still sought despite the growing darkness. A group of brilliant scientists, working under grim conditions manage to rekindle some semblance of power generation through eco-friendly sources that produce minimal heat and light without the use of fossil fuels. This discovery marks the beginning of a new era for humanity - one where infrastructure and power are reimagined and decentralized, based on clean and sustainable energy sources named 'Vulturian Wind Harvesters' and 'Minimal Bearing Sustainable Dynamo Engines'. The 'Elemental Reconstruction Therapy' reinvents society back to radical simplicity and emphasizes community resilience.

In the end, humanity doesn't perish but evolves. What was once seen as a world-weary terrorist attack becomes the catalyst for an existential debate on sustainability, pushing us all to rise above our fatal flaws and learn to adapt and cooperate under necessity and scarcity. This period leads us towards a more egalitarian society which embeds systemic thought into our DNA avoiding mistakes made historically - so may it be enigmatically written in my crystal ball.
